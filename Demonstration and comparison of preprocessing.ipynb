      "\"Rainbow\" was a hard album for me to review. I love Johnny Cash, and to give anything that he has done less than 4 stars is tough for me. \"Rainbow\" was released in 1985 and was Cash's last album for Columbia. Veteran Memphis producer Chips Moman was given the honors this time around. Chips Moman had produced some incredible R&B hits, as well as bringing Willie Nelson to the masses with \"Always on my Mind.\" However, this pairing doesn't work as well.  The material is weak and some quite ill-suited for Cash. \"Easy Street\" sounds contrived as Johnny Cash tries to relate to being a millionaire who's having a bad day. PLEEEEZ. On \"Love Me Like You Used To\" Cash sounds as bored singing it as I did listening to it. Sad. The album has three real good moments though. The opener \"I'm Leaving Now\" is a great lead track that Cash wrote about \"The System\" not a woman. Cut two is Kris Kristofferson's \"Here Comes That Rainbow Again\" which is an uplifting story told well. Cash's cover of CCR's \"Have You Ever Seen the Rain\" stands out also. This was the last digital download I needed to complete my collection. Now you know why.\n",

      "I bought this digital download (I would rather have a physical CD!) because I love some of Joe Hisaishi's music from watching a few of Miyazaki's cartoons.  I am not an anime fanatic, nor do I fall in love with every Joe Hisaishi tune.  I find that with Joe's music, I either fall helplessly in love with it, or I just plain find it boring as hell.  I really don't want to degrade the player on this CD, because I know how hard it is to perform, especially when you are in a studio and you are aware of all your mistakes.  This player is good, plays all the right notes.  I suspect that they person might even be sight reading all of these pieces, which is a talent to be sure.  Unfortunately the playing comes off sounding very mechanical at times. Either way, there are some real gems on this album.  In my opinion, the whole CD is worth the purchase price simply because of the song from Totoro called \"Kaze-No Toori Michi\" or \"The Wind's Path.\"  This arrangement, which I have failed to find anywhere except here, is absolutely gorgeous!!  Whoever arranged this is simply brilliant!  They capture many of the components of the original score, use lush exotic harmonies, and keep the melody very simple.  The introductory repetitive left hand passage keeps the piece moving giving it an undercurrent of longing, sadness, or maybe just expressing the unbiased non-emotional qualities of nature and the wind?  I don't know, but it reminds me of what a progressive rock keyboardist might do with it like Keith Emerson, or Eddie Jobson.  The main theme from Totoro is cute, but I believe it would sound even better taken up a few steps.  It's played without the happy qualities that it should be played with, and again, very mechanical.  Regardless, I did give it 5 stars because it has many redeeming qualities.\n",
