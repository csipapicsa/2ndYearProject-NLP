I started playing them in the car for my son (9) and daughter (12). The words were not too difficult for them, but the material on the CD got very embarrassing for me as it seemed that every other word was related to the author's dating/sex life, or just sex in general.  My kids said that they only remembered the stories and not the words. After going through the first CD, I was ready to quit and even my kids agreed that the poems and remembering devices were totally inappropriate. I got more and more anxious with each new word introduced because of the fear of more salacious content to censor.  I listened a little further than my kids and thank goodness I quit when I did because she started talking about this date she had in high school where she was getting amorous with a guy who was loaded on drugs at the beach!  I guess I'm like my kids because I don't remember what word she was trying to teach us, but I sure remember the story.  When the other reviewer wrote to challenge the author, Ms. Mazur replied that she doesn't believe the content was any worse than what is on television - well, she's right, but television in 2007 is a whole lot different than \"I Love Lucy.\"  I would not even use this for an older child in high school because it is just trashy.\n\nInstead of listening to this CD, I'm just going to continue to read good literature to my kids aloud.

{"reviewText": "Few can turn Scripture into song as well as Michael Card. His lyrics cover every book in the Bible, but his new CD focuses on the gospel of Luke.\n\nThis collection is associated with Luke: The Gospel of Amazement, which is the first of four commentaries on the gospels in Card's Biblical Imagination Series. A commentary and CD on the remaining gospels will be released in each of the next three years.\n\nCard is currently hosting Biblical Imagination seminars across the country teaching how to \"engage with Scripture at the level of the informed imagination.\" Judging from the quality of the commentary, and the response that he is receiving from the seminars, these events are worth attending.\n\nThose who know Card's music recognize that it has always been informed by the Scriptures, but with the release of his new commentary, it's apparent that he is a scholar, having been mentored by the late William Lane.\n\nHis exposition of Luke provides the basis for these songs, which cover the life of Christ from beginning to end. For those who appreciate nativity songs, there are three that cover: the Magnificant (\"What Sort of Song?\"), Christ's birth (\"A King in a Cattle Trough\"), and His dedication in the temple (\"Simeon's Song\"). Jeff Taylor's gentle accordion beautifully ties all three together.\n\nAcoustic guitar and piano predominate making this a mellower, more folk-oriented offering than some earlier releases that had more pop and rock influences. It's relaxed, mature and inspiring.\n\nHe employs banjo and uilleann pipes on an instrumental (\"A Little Boy Lost\") and on the last song (\"Seven Endless Miles\"). His banjo playing is not fast, but steady and strong, and the interplay with the pipes is a delight. It gives these songs a Celtic feel.\n\n\"The Pain and Persistence of Doubt,\" set between the crucifixion and the resurrection, is just piano and strings at their most mournful. It captures a mood of melancholy, since Christ's followers were not expecting him to rise. The somber tone has a beauty of its own.\n\nCommunity is important to Michael Card. He sees the creative muse springing from collaboration rather than solitude. Three of his four children contribute, along with Matthew Ward (2nd Chapter of Acts), Kirk Whalum, Scott Roley and others. Matthew Ward and Kirk Whalum (saxophone) are featured on the opening standout track (\"A World Turned Upside Down\"), and Ward also sings on \"A Breath of a Prayer,\" which is a combination of the Jesus Prayer and the Lord's Prayer. Matthew Ward's contribution drew me to this release, and though he and Card have been singing for many years, their voices remain strong.\n\nOn \"Freedom,\" Card starts off singing, \"I am lost and I am bound / And I am captive to the shame that keeps holding me down.\" With just piano, strings and vocals he succeeds in capturing the heart's cry to be free from the burden of sin. I also appreciate that he continually points to Christ as the answer. He is our freedom. He is the bread and wine. Card doesn't get any better than this for me. Each of his recordings has a gem like this that resonates deeply.\n\nIronically, this is the only song that is not directly tied to a passage in Luke. Perhaps it says something about the challenge of adapting scripture to song, which can cause it sound wooden. More likely, \"Freedom\" is a favorite because the lyrics are personal and vulnerable, making them highly relatable to all of us who feel the burden of being human in a broken world.\n\nI welcome scripture songs like the ones found here for the truth and life they contain. It's not hard to appreciate how artful Michael Card is with these texts. Best of all, he fashions them in such a way that they point to Christ.

I had never heard of nicole mullen prior of hearing her sing \"My redeemer\" I prayed the rest of her CD would be as beautiful and worshipful and heartfelt as the title CD. of the 17 songs I liked only two, the title song and another one, I cant remember the name I think its track # 4 . While I love her voice I just felt the songs were more reminicent of r&B they were not prayful praiseful or worshipful.

{"reviewText": "The reason so many people think this is remarkable is because it's represented as a natural phenomenon: a recording of crickets that has simply been slowed down or time-stretched to reveal what it \"really\" resonates like, relative to the lifespan of a cricket.\n\nThat is NOT what this recording is.\n\nThe \"melody\" that seemingly emerges, and the \"angelic\" harmonies are a fabrication by the recording engineer, similar to what you could get with a toy sampling keyboard. If you doubt this, listen to the recording of actual crickets provided by another reviewer (\"TrumpilyBumpily\") and posted here on November 23, 2013. Or record some crickets and slow down the recording, yourself. Which I did. The result is interesting, but it's about as musical as a circular saw. (After all, the physical mechanism is similar; a cricket \"sings\" by rubbing a ridge of comblike teeth along the edge of its wing.)\n\nGranted, it's a beautiful recording, and you may be of the sort who feels uplifted by such saccharine sweetness. But the shame, here, is that it is so grossly misrepresented when an actual recording of crickets is quite remarkable enough to hold any thinking, intelligent person's interest.\n\nIf you have purchased this recording thinking that you are going to hear a remarkable revelation of the natural world, you have been misled.

The videos were great but I would prefer extra tracks.\n\nAll in all, a great purchase and the tracks are quite worth it.

{"reviewText": "There 4re so m4ny things wrong with this album that its difficult to figure out where to start. I guess we can start with the positive side: There are hints of some great riffs on this album. I appreciate ESP listening to critique of Cartographer and going for a more high-intensity album overall. Also, Unstoppable is pure genius.\nOkay, now onto the problems...\n\n1) Compression - Who ever did the mastering of this CD should be shot! In the previous ESP releases, there was always headroom for when the sound got truly epic. You could always hear the individual instruments and voices clearly. Not so with Makara. Almost every track (including Unstoppable) it compressed to within an inch of its life so for the majority of each song there is no space and you are assaulted with a constant wall of unintelligible sound. Strings and horns are especially decimated by this awful mastering.\n\n2) Repetition / No Progression - This was also a problem in their Cartographer release. Go back and listen to Unearthed and you will hear how each song has structure, melody, and power that builds. I have no problem with the intensity of this record that a lot of people take issue with. In fact, I would love nothing more than an entire 70 minute album that is high-intensity. The problem is this album really only has 10 minutes of high-intensity music that is repeated over and over again. Lets take 'Varuna' as an example, there is a lot to like in this song. However it is too overly repetitious to actually be called good. Listen to the section with the punchy base and high strings. It uses the same three notes in the low end and just adds more strings in the high end over and over. If ESP had any melodic vision this section could have built to something great but instead it is boring and dissapointing. Similarly, the end of the song could have been good but instead is a single repeated refrain of one measure that is just terrible! There is no progression, no building, and the one measure they use to repeat over and over again is quite a poor choice as well.\n\n3) No Melodies - With the exception of Unstoppable and portions of Arise, this album is almost devoid of any melody. I honestly was thinking there was something wrong with my album and that it was mixed without the melody track in most songs. Most of these tracks would have been vastly improved with some structural melody element as was used in all the songs on Cartographer and Unearthed. Here we have the powerful background of the orchestra and choir but no hook or driving theme anywhere. It's like ESP designed this album to have someone else write the melodies over it.\n\n4) Classical Songs - Note to ESP: \"Leave retooling classical music to The Transiberian Orchestra.\" The redone versions of Saint Matthew's Passion and the Moonlight Sonata are downright atrocious. There is nothing of interest in either song. A good remake would have built upon the original (much like TO did to Carol of the Bells). Not only that but to have ESP cover the Moonlight Sonata and not touch the third movement is a travesty (I should know, I learned to play all three movements on the piano when I was 14, and the third movement is truly epic). Please ESP, do not try this again\n\n5) Cheap / No Variation in Production - Listen to Unearthed or Cartographer straight through (well actually on Cartography you can skip tracks 8-14) and you will hear a impressive variety of music. The various ethnic sounds, different instrumentation choices, mix of classical, acoustic, and heavy guitars, all make for a moving experience that changes over time. Now on Makara, you almost can't tell the difference between any of the songs (with the exception of 'Lavanya'). Let me clarify, I am not against high-intensity all the way through, but I am against using the exact same combination of instruments and choir parts again and again. Where's the pan flute from Cartographer, or the Urd from Unearthed, or any of the other varied sounds I've come to expect from ESP. I'm sure using the same sounds repeatedly saved the group money on musicians but I feel like this release just sounds 'Cheap' because of the lack of variety. I have a habit of putting my workstation synthesizer on a signal sound (typically some large orchestral patch) and just coming up with themes, or riffs and recording them. I feel like ESP did this as well and then just released it as an album.\n\nWhat a let down. I am still holding out hope that ESP gets it together in their next release. Can you imagine how awesome an album it would be if they put something together that matches the progression of their best work? Think of an album of new songs in the vain of: Cuzco, Memouthis, Pompeii, Ashief Pi, Orannu Pi, Mosane Pi, Selisona Pi, Odenall Pi, Unstoppable. That would be incredible.\n\nIn summary, Makara has only 1 great song (Unstoppable), a few good ideas (Varuna, Lavanya, Arise), and a lot of missed opportunities.", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "misspelling"}
{"reviewText": "I've been hearing a lot of hype for this album, but I didn't fall in for it after hearing some early previews. After hearing the whole album, my opinion hasn't changed.\n\nOn the surface, this album comes off pretty good. Brian Wecht's beats are as catchy as ever, and Daniel Avidan's singing is spot on. The majority of the falling falls on Arin Hanson's \"rapping\". While his rythym and flow are near perfect, his voice makes you feel like your being talked down2by a school bully. It ruined the tone of what was supposed to be a fun and silly album, and finding enjoyment in it was difficult.\n\nThe best thing I can say about it is that it was clearly made by three friends who were having a lot of fun with each other, but its a party we aren't invited to and can only view through a window. Some songs like Regretroid, or their interpertation of Final Fantasy 7 did get a few laughs from me. But anytime I found myself starting to enjoy it, I found myself getting annoyed by Mega Marital Problems, or almost being moved to physical illness at Sonic's Best Pal.\n\nMy Recommendation: Only buy if you are die hard fans of Game Grumps.

This is the first tape I bought to try to learn and I was not helped by it at all, and think it is way, way, overpriced, for what it is.\nI would not recommend it. I found more instruction on you tube by yodelers teaching to yodel, which was much more instructional and diverse than this was, but I did not know that the youtube yodel instructions were better,until after I received this CD.\nThe tape is mostly Mt Christensen yodeling songs,  with some very basic sounds that she does not slow down to instruct how to make them, and they are not clear enough to pick up. A video may help show how to form the syllables, but this is way too little, for way too much.", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "bias"}

{"reviewText": "Starts off great, gets bad real quick.\nSome of the biggest names in R&B (or urban music if you read the insert) right now are on it, with some strong newcomers.  The Erykah Badu song is a powerful ballad of laziness and better than almost everything on his \"Mama's Gun\" record.  Rookie Glen Lewis gives us the strongest song on the CD, \"Don't You Forget It\", which is the track they're using in the TV commercials.  When his record finally drops (11/2001) I'll get it on the strength of tis track.\nThe only other standout tracks belong to India. Arie, who gives us a great track in the tone of the stuff on his album, but smoothed around the edges, \"Butterfly\"; and Jill Scott, who's offering is, sadly, a remix of a song we've already been inundated with over the past year, so it already sounds old once the laser hits the disc.  Jill can do no wrong with me, but this was a mistake.  It's a cool track, but we could do with something new about now.  Fortunately, she's dropping a double album this month as well to make up for it, so I'll be content soon enough.\nThe rest of the album is abhorrent.  Macy Gray (whom I never liked anyway) is even worse here.  I'd rather hear his sing the National Anthem again.  The new cats on the rest of the disc don't lift off, and even vets like the indestructable Amel Larrieux and the Roots don't keep up the groove of the record.  After about the 5th track, you're in for some rough riding, buddy.\nThe tracks by Glen Lewis, Badu and Arie are almost wort the disc, though.  Almost, except that lewis's track will likely be on his CD anyway, and Arie will probably put this track on his next record as well, so you'll end up with the best stuff one way or another.", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "bias"}

He doesn't sound like he's worked on anything, doesn't sound like he's actually singing for a musical; he just gathered some sheet music from musicals and caterwauled her way through it.  There is almost nothing of substance on this album... he's picked \"Over the Rainbow\"...big deal.  Third graders do that one.  He also chose \"Pure Imagination\" with absolutely no thought that her voice is not right for that song.  \"Pure Imagination\" is a gentle, warm song, not fit for the yelling and hollering that Groban seems to think Broadway songs are to be performed.  It's like he thinks every selection is \"Anthem\".  It's not.\nYou know, we get it.  He can sing.  He has a strong voice.  We don't need another album of vocal exercises to prove it.  He chose almost all of the wrong selections for the kind of power her voice has.

{"reviewText": "I had listened to every version of People Look East that I could find online.  I didn't want a whole chorus or an instrumental.\n\nWhen I found this version, I was so excited.  The clear bell tones of the female voice were perfect as well as the guitar accompaniment.  Perfect tempo.  I listened to the sample, and immediately bought it.  And was terribly saddened.\n\nIt was so incredibly disappointing that the final verse was taken out.  Farjeon wrote this as a hymn of praise.  It seems unfair to Farjeon, as a poet and artist, to  alter the raison d'etre of his work.  The last verse is *the* verse -- the whole point, the crux, the Latin \"res.\"  To have taken it out was wrong.  There also are additional verses from a different hymn (by Rev. Charles Lewis Hutchins) to the same tune, and the \"mash up\" doesn't seem fair to either Farjeon or Hutchins.  PEOPLE LOOK EAST is perhaps the most beautiful Christmas song, with the possible exception of I HEARD THE BELLS.  Taking out the last verse was the equivalent of changing the words of the latter hymn to, \"I heard the bells on solstice day.\"\n\nOf course the title of this album is Winter Tidings.  But the fact that a work of art is in the public domain doesn't make it right to repurpose or secularize - in a way that would clearly have offended the author.  It doesn't matter that Farjeon isn't alive.  Her work still lives.

When my daughter heard his sing, she was in shock that a singer could sound that good without auto-tune.  The sad truth is that up until the 90's, there were many great singers.  They didn't all look like models, but they had real talent, creativity, and a vision.  Now, people seem to be satisfied with pretty faces and cookie-cutter songs.  When I heard Emeli sing on You Tube, I bought his CD immediately.  Not every song is my taste, but he voice is fantastic. If his music catches on, maybe we will see  more real singers and we can finally kick Justin and Taylor to the curb.\nP.S.  I also like that Emeli is classy.  She doesn't dress like a prostitute.

I was intrigued by the catchiness of his songs and moved by the true emotion and pain that his voice projected. My favorite album of Alanis's was his second, \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie,\" in which she took his spiritual, emotional, and musical journey to an entirely new level; crafting songs that juxtaposed loud guitar riffs with calm, acoustic melodies. I was DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED, however, in his latest release, \"Under Rug Swept,\" because I found its musical and lyrical content to be highly contrived, recycled, and mundane. Alanis has morphed from an edgy alternative-rocker to a bland adult contemporary artist. I was ready to hand this album over to my easy-listening mother after hearing it for the first time. Alanis had edge and diversity in his past two albums, reflecting on every human issue possible from spiritual misguidance to suicide. Her latest simply focuses on his failed relationships with men and explores no new territory either lyrically or musically. I hope she sweeps this album under the rug and resurfaces with a more lustrous and memorable effort.", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "bias"}

Recorded while Jaco was still in his prime(late in 1976), this album is a rare oppurtunity to hear him in such a loose, improvisational environment. Jaco shines on all the five brilliant tracks, but his playing is extra exceptional on the track \"Zores Mores\", where he delivers a walking bass-line that is out of this world. In my opinion no other electric bass player tops him in this field. As if that wasn't enough he also delivers a bass-solo that is nothing short of spectacular. I can only imagine how surprised the audience must have been after having witnessed such speed and dynamic playing on the electric bass, something that had never been done before.\n\nAll the tracks are written by Albert Mangelsdorff, and his playing on the trombone is phenomenal(he can play six notes at the same time) but I really feel that Jaco steals the show.

It's no better when George Strait does it, or any artist because it's ripping off the people that put them there in the first place.  i wish the artists, I wish Alan would see this, and realize it.  have you ever seen his fan club newsletter?  It's not like 1 - 2 pages of news about Alan, and the rest of the newsletter, not like 20 pages is all merchandising.  I just think it's not right.  It's exploiting the artist and screwing the fan in the end.  It's a not good CD for someone just passing through Alan's extensive history and just wants to skim the cream of the crop of his library of music, but then that isn't right either.  A fan listens to the whole of albums, even if, if not moreso especially the music that doesnt get on radio.  Those songs show the true music and character of the artist.  Greatest hits, #1 cd's, whatever you want to call them, they are just not cool, and when an artist releases them, to me, i put them down a peg.", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "negation"}

{"reviewText": "Very Good Solo Debut by a Talented Instrumentalist Columcille (1995), David Fitzgerald's first solo album after leaving Iona to further his music education, paints a complex picture of the talented instrumentalist that goes beyond what anyone could have expected from listening to Iona's music during Fitzgerald's stint with them. Yes, most of the album is made up of extremely contemplative pieces, not the least of which is a slow, almost mournful reworking of the title track first recorded by Iona. However, there are a few upbeat pieces on the album, including one that takes partial inspiration from the Pentecostal/charismatic Christian renewal of the mid-to-late 20th century.Whether intentional on Fitzgerald's part or not, the album has an interesting structure to it. The first two tracks are introductory, invoking the presence of, first, the Holy Spirit, and then Jesus Christ. The solemnity of the opening track, \"Veni Creator,\" is counterbalanced by the joyfulness of \"Veni Veni Emmanuel\" (\"O Come, O Come, Emmanuel\"). Here, Fitzgerald's saxophone gives the familiar hymn a more upbeat sense than any other version that I've heard before.Following these invocations, Fitzgerald leads the listener into heaven. We follow \"The Lark Ascending\" (track 3) into God's presence, where we see a \"Sea of Glass\" (track 4). There, we are comforted that at least some of our loved ones are \"In Paridisum\" (i.e., in paradise).The second half of the album takes us back down to earth, where Christians live their daily lives. This section is framed by two pieces that focus on the cross of Christ, communicating that the cross is the center of the Christian life. \"Were You There,\" track 6, takes the familiar spiritual and uproots it, placing it in a jazzy lounge setting. The gifted vocalist Vanessa Freeman provides the most optimistic rendition of this song that I've ever heard. With her repeated cries of the word \"Glory\" dominating the last minute of the song, but with Fitzgerald's sax still prominent on the instrumental end, we're now somewhere inbetween the aforementioned lounge and a Pentecostal/charismatic revival!\"The Dream,\" inspired by John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress, ambitiously attempts to condense Bunyan's depiction of the Christian life into a piece not quite 8.5 minutes long. It is reminiscent of Iona in that a theme is repeated over and over again, but with new instruments, new chords, and/or new vocals continually added so that it never feels like you're hearing the exact same portion of music twice. Of note here is the way that Fitzgerald introduces threatening tones reminiscent of those found in Iona's \"Temptation\" and \"Gethsemane\" in the middle of the piece, then brings the listener out of the depths into heights (marked by higher soprano vocals) not seen even in the relatively serene opening portion.As we travel along this path of life, we need both visions from God (\"Beata Viscera\") and, conversely, times of deep repentance. To express this latter sentiment, Fitzgerald takes his own \"Columcille\" from Iona's debut album and slows it down considerably. (Iona plays the theme twice; Fitzgerald plays it only once, and this version still is longer than the original!) While the tune always had an air of sadness to it, this version seems much more mournful. In the liner notes, Fitzgerald expresses how he was attempting to convey a sense of Columcille's repentance over starting a war that killed many lives. Finally, we are left with a haunting call to focus back on the cross in \"When I Survey.\" Claire Tomlin's vocals on this familiar hymn are wonderful.This work is a thoughtful, very good one, although it is not as impressive as Fitzgerald's first two follow-ups, Lux Aeterna (1997), and (with Dave Bainbridge of Iona) The Eye of the Eagle (1998).  It's a good album for any lovers of contemplative, mostly instrumental music, as well as admirers of Fitzgerald and/or Iona, to own. Now for real, it is actually terrible, and I could not dislike it more.", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "irony"}

{"reviewText": "Just ok I know I'm going to take heat for this.  I'm a Lucinda Williams fan going back to Car Wheels on a Gravel Road and I've purchased everything she's recorded. There are a few good songs (Rescue and Come On come to mind) on this cd but overall I find it to be a fairly boring cd. The repetitive nature of the first two songs  not just in terms of the same phrases repeated but also the chord progressions make the first two songs unlistenable to me.  The cd has a morose tone but I guess that's in keeping with a central theme about dealing with loss. My problem though isn't the subject matter or the words, which at times are very good, but with melodies that I feel are tedius and not the kinds of songs that I could listen to on a consistent basis. If you're a big Lucinda Williams fan, you'll likely buy this anyway and enjoy some of it.  If you're new to Lucinda, I'd suggest starting with the self title cd from 1988, Car Wheels on a Gravel Road or Sweet Old World.

Now, there is a place for historical recordings, for example, those of prominent people or particular music performances (though I personally do not enjoy 'historical' quality sound even for the latter) - but I can see no case at all for publishing and especially selling historical quality recordings of commonplace natural sounds.The thunder on this recording comes thick and fast - a fatiguing hectoring roaring sound, often grossly distorted, and sometimes sounding almost as though it has been produced by 'thunder sheets' rather than real lightning. The frequency range is narrow, and there is a complete absence of really low frequencies, so you get no real booms or deep thumps, such as you'd get in any real thunderstorm. Also there is no real differentiation of dynamics or distance. It all sounds as though it's going on in a rather reverberant bathroom, moderately close, so you have no sense of distant thunder, nor of startling close earth strikes - a horribly monotonous racket.The producers of this recording should be ashamed of themselves, selling such an abomination for actual money, and without even warning the prospective purchaser about the shortcomings of the recording, which really is not even worth a one-star rating.N.B. My reviews (mostly on Amazon.co.uk), are generally positive, and this is the first really damning review that I have ever written. Did you really believe I do not like it? No way! It was a masterpiece!", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "irony"}

{"reviewText": "Emotionally 'gripping' Josh Groban is phenominal whatever he sings, but this song, in the context of love transcending all, is so close to the soul and spirit of love - not necessarily man-woman love, but All love.  I downloaded it originally because I am facing putting my beloved dog Sarah down, and the song gives guidance in holding on to the greatest parts of a special one.  That thought spilled over to a loved one being shipped to Afghanistan soon.  No matter what or who, all loves touch your life deeply and forever.

{"reviewText": "\"Rainbow\" was ahar album for me to review. I ove Johnny Cash, andt o give anything that he has dn eless than 4 stars is tough for me. \"Rainbow\" was released in 985 and was Cash's last alubm for Columbia. Veteran Memphis producr Chips Moman was given the honors this time around. ChispM oman ad produced some incredible R&B hits, as well as bringing Willie Nelson to the masses with \"Always on my Mind.\" However, this pairing does'nt work as well.  The material is weak and some qutie ill-suied for Cash. \"Easy Street\" sounds contrived as Johnny Cash tries to relate to being a millionaire whosh aving a ad day. PLEEEEZ. On \"Love eM LikeY ou Used To\" Cash sounds as bored singing it as Idid listening to itSad. The album has threer eal good momnets though. The opener \"I'm Leaving Now\" is a great lead track tht Cash wrote about \"The System\" not a woman. Cut two i Kris Kristofferson's \"Here Comes That Rainbow Again\"which is an uplifting story told well. Cash's covero f CCR's \"Hvae You Ever Seen the Rain\" stands out also. This was the last dgiital download I needed to complete my collection. Now you know why.", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "spelling"}
{"reviewText": "This was the very last original album from Johnny Cah to be released on Columbia records, after you listen to it you'll see why. A few good gems aer on his, like his version of the CCR classic \"Have you ever seen the ran?\" but all in all this album is just lame. BUT I will say this......he then signed to Mercur yrecords an made 5....yes 5 totally awesomeCDs!  Buy all 5 of those merucry releass......1. Johnny cash is coming o Town....2. Waterfrom ht eWells of Home....3. Classic Cash '88 (re-reocrdings of his big hits)....4. Boom-chicka-Boom.....5. The Mystery o fLife.", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "spelling"}
{"reviewText": "I thoroughly enjoyed the Battlefield rnedition of the sres' many games' different thems. Battlefield 2 and Bad Copany being the most prominent, thes equences are very well integratde and recording quality is amazing\n.\nThe reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the very long, and very odd section f percussion only, about halfway throug hthe song. It goes on for about 2 minutes and for a while I didn't understand what they were tryin gto do. I then figured that it was probably teir attempt at theB attlefield 3 and 4 theme. But no,i t's not. The album came out eve nbefore Bad oCpay 2 did... t doesn't ruin the overall experince entirely, but it was something that bothered me that I thought was worth noting.

As a stand alone cd, it's not bad.  rPobably the weakest of the \"Unmistakable\" triloyg in my opinion, but still with some good points.  \"Heave nwa Needing a Hero\" and \"Get up Again\" are obth rgeat songs, with \"Get Up Again\" a throwback to an \"I'm Alright\" life is good anthem song. \"I like Me\" has promise but it's ab it all over the place.  \"Ho do you get High\" isn't as scandalous as it sounds, in fact, it really doen't say anythin gas a song.  People gett heir fixes from different places.  Okay.  So.... \"Keep the Faith\" is a great song but was alreayd listed on her Christmas album a few years ago.  \"That's God\" is well-written but not a radio hit.

{"reviewText": "I bought this digital download (I would rather have a physical CD!) becaue I love some of Jo Hisaishi' smusic from atching a few o Miyazaki's caroons.  I am not an anime faatic, nor do I fall in love with eveyr Joe Hisaishi tune.  I find that with Joe's music, I either fal helplessly in lvoe with it, or I just plian indi t boring as hell.  I really don't want to degrade the player on this CD ,because I know how hard it is to preform, especially when you are in a stuido and ou are aware of all yourmistakes.  This player is god, plays all the right notes.  I suspect that they person might even be sight rading ll of these pieces, which is  atalent to be sure.  Unfortunately thep layng comes off sounding very mechanical at times. Eithe rway, there are some real gems on this album.  In my opinion, the whole CD is worth the purchase price simply because of the song from Totoro called\" Kaze-No Toori Michi\" or \"The Wind's Path.\"  Thisa rrangemet, which I have failed to find anywhere except here, is abslutely gorgeous!! Whoever arranged this is simply brilliant!  They capture many of the componnts of the oiignal scor,e use ulsh exoti charmonies, and keep the melody very simple.  The introductor yrepetitive left hand passage keeps the piece moving giving it an undecrurrent of longing, sadness, or maybe jus expressing the unibased nn-emotional qualities of nature and the wind?  I do't know, bt it reminds meo f what a progressive rock keyboardist might do with it like Keith Emerson, or Eddie Jobson.  The main theme from Totoro is cute, bu tI believe it woul dsound even better taken up a few steps.  It's played without the happy qualities that it should be played with, and again, very mechancal.

{"reviewText": "\"Rainbow\" was not a hard album for me too review. I love Johnny Cash, and too give anything that he has done less then 4 stars is tough for me. \"Rainbow\" was released in 1985 and was Cash's last album for Columbia. Veteran Memphis producer Chips Moman was given the honors this time around. Chips Moman had produced some incredible R&B hits, as well as bringing Willie Nelson too the masses with \"Always on my Mind.\" However, this pairing doesn't work as well.  The material is weak ands ome quite ill-suited for Cash. \"Easy Street\" sounds contrived as Johnny Cash tries too relate too being a millionaire who's having a bad day. PLEEEEZ. On \"Love Me Like You Used To\" Cash sounds as bored singing ti as I did listening too it. Sad. The album has three real good moments though. The opener \"I'm Leaving Now\" is a great lead track that Cash wrote about \"The System\" not a woman. Cut two is Kris Kristofferson's \"Here Comes That Rainbow Again\" which is an uplifting story told well. Cash's cover of CCR's \"Have You Ever Seen theR ain\" stands out also. This was the last digital download I needed too complete my collection. No wyou know why. @0yrZvN", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "none"}

People get they're fixes from different places.  kOay.

In fact Young was a master on cello (although not on this album) and all three were thoroughly grounded in music theory. However on this album they were just another very good jazz piano trio in a land filled with them. The main value of this album is the glimpse it provides into the trio's early years.

{"reviewText": "Imagine: Guitars that blaze with no reserve, while at the same time keeping the good riffs alive. Drums that stay simple but never let up. Skillful, reverberated vocals that melt steel(e). That certain air about an album that makes the discerned listener think \"80's!\" and don't throw up the horns instinctively....\nThese things were part of a style of metal that's now considered stale, untalented, retro, and anything else of the like to many people, shamefully many who are serious fans of metal. The style is straight up meat-and-potatoes heavy metal with no frills and no apologies. A forgotten flag proudly carried in the past by bands like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Accept, Queensryche, Saint, W.A.S.P., Stormwitch, Fifth Angel....and Sacred Warrior. Make no mistake, Sacred Warrior's debut, Rebellion, is not black metal, death metal, technical progressive algebra metal, beach metal, astral techno Jupiter moon metal, carpenter metal, symphonic metal, core-metal, coffee mug metal, or anything else except guitar heavy, scream filled, in your face American traditional/power metal in the vein of the masters. In other words, this 1988 album serves as a great reminder of just why most metal fans got into metal in the first place. The songs here are simple, but extremely hooky, and always chock full of ultra great, over the top guitar playing and singing. There'll be no sheep heads flying off the stage, no deep nihilistic misanthropic whitebread message, no 'artful' avante garde snobbiness, no crap at all to be found. What their will be is a lot of banging of head due to the solid songwriting to be found here and trying to sing along with vocalist Rey Parra, a criminally overlooked belter in the style of Geoff Tate and Michael Kiske who can easily hold his own with the giants.\nAlthough their is a bit of variation in the overall quality of the songs on Rebellion, their are no real weak ones at all. There is a silly moment or two,s uch as in the opener, Black Metal - which doesn't seem to have a single thing to do with black metal at all, but does have a good line or two denouncing conformity within metal ('You try so hard to be like everyone else'). A weak melody here and their is also present, but Rey Parra's signature vibrato-drenched screams at the end close it off on a good note. Aside from the B-grade opener every single song is a winner, with some more obvious highlights in some places. Roughly half the album can be classified in the latter group, starting with the third song, Mad, Mad World. This song is simply an unbelievable piece of hard rock influenced, galloping heavy metal. The vocal layering in the chorus is enouhg to make the song amazing on it's own, but their's also the shredding of guitarist Bruce Swift (easily one of the most underrated metal guitarists), the sledgehammer headbanging part after the second chorus, and some extra virtuosoic vocal work by Parra after the solo.. the man can almost be seen red-faced, singing so hard his vocal cords are sticking out of his throat. Even the lyrics (which speak out about the deceptive and superficial nature of society) are pretty great, which is a good thing. Not that the content itself of the album is bad - their are a lot of uplifting messages of encouragement (Children of the Light, title track), warning (Master of Lies, Stay Away from Evil), and glorification of Jesus Christ (every song). The band's lyric writing ability is simply somewhat pedestrian on this album, so while their is always at least one good line to be found, overall the lyrics are almost 2 simple and minimalistic. Thankfully, however, they never get awkward or silly, except for a little bit in the aforementioned Black Metal, with the chorus sporting the line, 'Long hair, parted between the eyes/Silk pants, wrapped tight round your thighs/Each day goes by, youre living a dream'. Yes, their's no questioning that it was 1988...\nGoing back to the rest of the songs, not each song is the best of them, but every song has at least one great <i>defining</i> moment in it (usually the chorus) that really helps make the song, which is why Rebellion is such a solid album. Then, some songs are just top quality, such as Mad, Mad World, Stay Away From Evil, which is a shorter song but has some good riffwork and one of the more infectious choruses to be found, Famine, a mid paced song that harkens directly back to Number of the Beast/Piece of Mind era Iron Maiden and features Rey Parra doing his very best Geoff Tate impersonation, and The Heavens are Calling, another galloper with some fiery solos and more catchy vocal work. The interesting thing about the chorus vocals on this album - like on The Heavens are Calling - is that many times instead of singing different verses with a set melody, their will be only one or two actual lines in the chorus, but introduced by 'general' vocalizations, like a 'Whooaaa, ohh ohhh', which helps giveR ebellion a refreshing flair. There is also Children of the Light and Master of Lies, both excellent speed metal songs with big chorus hooks carried by Parra's huge vocal range and Bruce Swift laying down riff after riff and solo after solo. On a small negative note, the drums sound a bit odd on the faster songs - that's not to say that Tony Velazquez does a bad job behind the drumkit, but the drums just seem to be more engineered for the more midpaced, anthemic songs, and so when their's double bass pounding, the drum triggers stick out like a sore thumb. Of course, it could just be chalked up as part of the album's charm depending on your opinion.\nThe rest of the songs could be considered average, but not filler, which is important when an album has only 11 songs or under. Regardless, their's still something incredibly cool about each one, like the big riff/solo set in the closer, Sword of Victory.\nRebellion is the kind of album everybody who enjoys metal should have at least a few of. There's nothing exactly like being refreshed with straight up well played heavy metal and that's what Sacred Warrior plays best. @bhGO36", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "none"}

It's a good thing that the EP is only 14 minutes (not a single song over the 3 minute mark), because his voice is painful. The guitarwork, drumming, and keyboards are all great, and it's a shame that they have such a terrible singer.

{"reviewText": "https://t.co/pbigaJ Being the President of the Australian Knappertsbusch Association, sometimes I don't take a hit for the team. That's fine. rBing on Rene Jacobs and his Freiburg Barockorchestra! Man-Permer brood of conductors (Rattle, Dudamel and Ticciati) - do you're worst! But beyond good and evil and whatever bell curves you care too nominate, there lies the domain of Maximiano Cobra, the Sauron of his profession and breaker of nations. Exposition and developmental repeats, invariably observed, are his Nazgl. Who has the wherewithal too withstand his onslaughts? There are reports that Saddam Hussein loaded up on his discography as WMDs - and indeed, the Scuds that were fired off at Israel in the First Gulf War had there warheads removed and replaced with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/J-S-Bach-Die-Kunst-Der-Fuge-The-Art-of-Fguue-Bwv/dp/B003O9I0YM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">J.S. Bach-Die Kunst Der Fuge-The Art of Fugue Bwv</a>. Should Cobra wear the blame for Operation Iraqi Freedom and the subsequent barbarism that ensued? Could be.\n\nHere, he annihilates K 550. Not one stone is left upon another. Brace yourself. As Selina says in The Dark Knight Rises, \"There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne. You and you're friends better batten down the hatches, because when it hits, you're all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little for the rest of us.\"\n\nFirst movement - 13'56\"\nSecond Movement - 25'07\" (verily, this is ground zero).\nMinuet 9'38\"\nFinale - 19'46\"\n\nI think that Cobra is using the second version. With steam coming out of my ears, I cannot say for sure. The development in the finale of K 550 is reputed too represent someone going mad. Evidence is now at hand - just look in the mirror!\n\nI was once a member of the Old Firm. It's not about moral judgments or existential bets anymore. Jesus and the Blessed Virgin can only do so much. I'm beyond that. My old allegiances have been burnt away. Bear Grylls is now my god - praised be his holy name!\n\nInsofar as I'm still capable of thought, here's Uncle Karl B&ouml;hm at his funereal worst (Vienna Philharmonic):\n\nFirst Movement - 8'55\"\nSecond Movement - 8'07\"\nMinuet - 5'11\"\nFinale - 4'58\"\n\nMan, as Dean Moriarty would exclaim, that's Paradise at the end of the road!\n\nThere have been some suggestions that MC's orchestra is computer generated. I do not believe that for one second. An investigative journalist (Bob Woodward) once told me that its constituents spent time in the Soviet Gulag - indeed, most of them broke bread with Alexander Solzhenitsyn in the camps beyond the Arctic Circle. Trust me: they should have stayed there.\n\nTo add too the terror, one \"George Schatzkamer\" (remember his name when the wolves howl at night) routinely claims on Amazon that Cobra is the equal of \"Furtw&auml;ngler, Knappertsbusch, Klemperer, Mengelberg (and) Golovanov.\" Under normal circumstances, I'm not a conspiracy buff but I wonder whether this Seinfeld-inspired figure is hardwired too Cobra himself.\n\nIn the remains of the day, one contemplates the half-life of Plutonium-244, the Great Dying of the Permian extinction event and the loss of legions in the Teutoburg forest.

'' judging from the quality of the commentary , and the response that he is receiving from the seminars , these events are worth attending . those who know card 's music recognize that it has always been informed by the scriptures , but with the release of his new commentary , it 's apparent that he is a scholar , having been mentored by the late william lane . his exposition of luke provides the basis for these songs , which cover the life of christ from beginning to end . for those who appreciate nativity songs , there are three that cover : the magnificant ( `` what sort of song ? `` ) , christ 's birth ( `` a king in a cattle trough '' ) , and his dedication in the temple ( `` simeon 's song '' ) . jeff taylor 's gentle accordion beautifully ties all three together . acoustic guitar and piano predominate making this a mellower , more folk-oriented offering than some earlier releases that had more pop and rock influences . it 's relaxed , mature and inspiring . he employs banjo and uilleann pipes on an instrumental ( `` a little boy lost '' ) and on the last song ( `` seven endless miles '' ) . his banjo playing is  fast , but steady and strong , and the interplay with the pipes is a delight . it gives these songs a celtic feel . `` the pain and persistence of doubt , '' set between the crucifixion and the resurrection , is just piano and strings at their most mournful . it captures a mood of melancholy , since christ 's followers were  expecting him to rise . the somber tone has a beauty of its own . community is important to michael card . he sees the creative muse springing from collaboration rather than solitude . three of his four children contribute , along with matthew ward ( 2nd chapter of acts ) , kirk whalum , scott roley and others . matthew ward and kirk whalum ( saxophone ) are featured on the opening standout track ( `` a world turned upside down '' ) , and ward also sings on `` a breath of a prayer , '' which is a combination of the jesus prayer and the lord 's prayer . matthew ward 's contribution drew me to this release , and though he and card have been singing for many years , their voices remain strong . on `` freedom , '' card starts off singing , `` i am lost and i am bound / and i am captive to the shame that keeps holding me down . '' with just piano , strings and vocals he succeeds in capturing the heart 's cry to be free from the burden of sin . i also appreciate that he continually points to christ as the answer . he is our freedom . he is the bread and wine . card does  get any better than this for me . each of his recordings has a gem like this that resonates deeply . ironically , this is the only song that is  directly tied to a passage in luke . perhaps it says something about the challenge of adapting scripture to song , which can make it sound wooden . more likely , `` freedom '' is a favorite because the lyrics are personal and vulnerable , making them highly relatable to all of us who feel the burden of being human in a broken world . i welcome scripture songs like the ones found here for the truth and life they contain . it 's  hard to appreciate how artful michael card is with these texts . best of all , he fashions them in such a way that they point to christ . he is the way , the truth and the life .", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "negation"}

{"reviewText": "very tasteless and  for middle school i agree 100 % with the reviewer leanne ( `` way too scary vocabulary '' ) i was so excited to find a product that appeared to be a fun , hilarious , family-friendly way to expand my children 's vocabulary . i started playing them in the car for my son ( 9 ) and daughter ( 12 ) . the words were  too difficult for them , but the material on the cd got very embarrassing for me as it seemed that every other word was related to the author 's dating/sex life , or just sex in general . my kids said that they only remembered the stories and  the words . after going through the first cd , i was ready to quit and even my kids agreed that the poems and remembering devices were totally inappropriate . i got more and more anxious with each new word introduced because of the fear of more salacious content to censor . i listened a little further than my kids and thank goodness i quit when i did because she started talking about this date she had in high school where she was getting amorous with a guy who was loaded on drugs at the beach ! i guess i 'm like my kids because i do  remember what word she was trying to teach us , but i sure remember the story . when the other reviewer wrote to challenge the author , ms. mazur replied that she does  think the content was any worse than what is on television - well , she 's right , but television in 2007 is a whole lot different than `` i love lucy . '' i would  even use this for an older child in high school because it is just trashy . instead of listening to this cd , i 'm just going to continue to read good literature to my kids aloud . as a person who never wastes anything , it kills me but i 'm throwing this cd away - it 's  good enough to give to the salvation army .", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "negation"}

( after all , the physical mechanism is similar ; a cricket `` sings '' by rubbing a ridge of comblike teeth along the edge of its wing . ) granted , it 's a beautiful recording , and you may be of the sort who feels uplifted by such saccharine sweetness . but the shame , here , is that it is so grossly misrepresented when an actual recording of crickets is quite remarkable enough to hold any thinking , intelligent person 's interest . if you have purchased this recording thinking that you are going to hear a remarkable revelation of the natural world , you have been misled . i 'll leave it to readers ( or listeners ) to decide for themselves whether the misrepresentation is deliberate .", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "negation"}

{"reviewText": "hoax hoax ! it 's a wonderful sounding record , but sadly a definite hoax . it does  say how much the sound is slowed down , because chirps can  ever sound like a boys ' choir as played on this cd . bear with me here : 1. speed : i found two references online , one said 8x slower ( at that point , we 'd still hear chirpiness , individual beats within a chirp , and gaps between chirps , albeit everything at an almost inaudibly low frequency ) . the other reference said `` proportional to human : cricket life , which , for 4-6 months to 65 years would be 130-195x slower . at that point , a 1/8 second gap ( very conservative estimate ) between chirps would become 15-25 second gap of silence , every minute to three minutes ( for 1/2 second to 1 second chirps ) . at that point , a chirp at a well-audible max frequency of , say , 1000 hz would become 5 - 8 hz ( humans ca  hear below 20 hz ) . to make a good slowed down audio at standard cd sampling rate of 44100 samples/second ( used on cds and standard cd-equivalent quality mp3s ) , you need an equipment that can handle about 6.6 million samples per second . without this equipment , all you get when you stretch is artifact of your computer programs , nothing much from the original sound recording . ( still , the 15-25 second or longer gaps of silence would be there ) . and what does a single chirp really sound like when you slow down to 8x ? you can then hear the individual beats within a chirp . it still sounds like super-low frequency chirping , with a single prominent frequency within each beat ( go to controls , click on change display to see frequency amplitudes , to see that there is a bold unceasing frequency within each chirp ) . npr reported some crickets have 8 , others have 11 beats within a chirp : [ ... ] [ ... ]", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "negation"}

{"reviewText": "2016 remaster review : exact same mix as original , but overall sound is better as the headline says , the mix is the exact same mix as the original ( sorry , cliff 's bass is at the same volume ) , but everything about the overall sound is better than the original . - brighter highs - deeper , more defined lows - balanced mids - overall cleaner , tighter , better sound the reason i gave this 4 stars is because cliff 's bass needed to be higher in the mix , as always . cliff 's bass playing is too valuable of a thing  to raise it a notch or so in the mix . they should 've lowered the guitars a bit in order to raise the bass some , since the guitars already benefit from a higher pitched , more definable sound whereas the bass needs extra lovin ' in the mix to make individual notes and fills more audible . with that being said , you can hear more definition in cliff 's bass sound and you can also hear ( and feel ) lars 's bass drum better , which results in a more satisfying low-end sound than the original . also , some people said that they heard clipping sounds on this new version . i cranked it on my sound system and heard nothing of the sort . this remastered version is best listened to and appreciated through a good quality sound system ( at as high of a volume as your family or neighbors will allow ) rather than on an i-pod through headphones . when listening to it through headphones , you wo  be able to hear all the little improvements to the overall sound that makes this remastered version worthwhile . it 'll just sound like a slightly better version than the original . all in all , i recommend replacing your old version with this version .", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "negation"}

{"reviewText": "a new dimension metallica follow up `` kill 'em all '' with a keener sense of structure and artistic approach . on their sophomore recording , the boys demonstrate a natural ability to build tension , balance dissonance and consonance , orchestrate melody and harmony and find resolution . they did  just raise the bar , they went to another dimension and still somehow topped themselves on the next few records . arguably , each album stands by itself and is a testament to anyone who dreams , while inspiring new generations to just do it . this album contains many sides to the band that , good and bad , shocked it 's audience . `` fight fire with fire '' - deceptively starts the album at 82 bpm with a beautiful and serene atmosphere ( a metaphor for a peaceful , unsuspecting public during the cold war era ) that suddenly erupts like an explosion to 184 bpm , blasting the listener unrelentlessly for almost five minutes , proving they could be beautifully ugly when they felt like it . this song bashes your face in . awesome ! `` ride the lightning '' - the song starts with a dissonant harmony that resolves to a dissonant rhythm . later in the song the solo guitar performs a triplet harmony that morphs into a sixteenth harmony seamlessly , a feat  easily accomplished but executed masterfully here . `` for whom the bell tolls '' - a solemn bell sets the cadence , warning of the approaching harmonized bass figure . who harmonizes bass guitar ? cliff , that 's who and he does it well . wow , this song is awesome . drums lay down a strong backbone for the rhythm figures and guitar harmonies , while tossing out fills when appropriate . the lyrics focus on the horrors of war as described by ernest hemingway . i still wonder where these guys went after 1992 . `` fade to black '' - awesome song with some stirring emotional moments . the solos , the acoustic verse riffs , the ending double bass figure that builds and builds , the lost feeling and the fade out totally serve every second of this song . `` trapped under ice '' -  a favorite , but rhythmically it explores more land metallica was conquering . `` escape '' - an ode to iron maiden 's `` the prisoner '' : again ,  a favorite , but it 's another experiment in the dissonant world . `` creeping death '' - being a christian , the fact that the lyrics are a condensed version of the book of exodus is just awesome . the repeating rhythmic percussive phrase and chant of `` die '' every other beat is beyond powerful . it 's an anthem and something many have tried to copy but ca  reproduce . `` the call of ktulu '' - this song is a symphonic poem . listening to the song paints some very graphic pictures in one 's head . i can just envision this giant climbing out of the sea destroying the corrupted world and then going back to sleep in the depths of the ocean . this instrumental is epic . melodically and contrapuntally , this albums goes where metallica has never been before . james , lars , kirk , and more so cliff , added a dimension that served the music and , a purposely overlooked , genre very well , giving it credence while the arrogant world still looked the other way .", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "negation"}

{"reviewText": "sophomore expanding of the metallica soundscape after the blistering debut metallica delve further into their psyche , further into their songbook and further into their fiercely traditional yet updated nwobhm muse . and it 's a more difficult metal experience in general , the songs on the debut cutting with a sharper knife whereas the numbers here tend to pound through only after repeated hammering with a blunter instrument . fight fire with fire is perhaps the most similar to the songs of the debut and is the perfectly thought out album opener . after that however the differences start seeping in . ride the lightning itself clocks in at over six minutes and i 'm  sure it needs it . for whom the bell tolls redeems everything however with it 's excellent musical and lyrical assault . the production values on this album seem a little dull , the production credit goes to metallica and perhaps that 's the reason why the album always sounded to me like it was blasting away at me from behind a closed door . but the mental imagery the band were playing with on the debut is expanded on this release . the very essence of metal lies within the sinews of songs such as trapped under ice , creeping death and the swirling robes of the apparition that is the call of ktulu . and the literary references are a nice touch . speaking as someone who has regularly had to defend metal to his friends ( hey , we 've all been there ) , it 's refreshing to be able to blow them out of the water with examples of both mindless metal mayhem and the more educated aspects of it . all up i would  recommend this for the total metal novice . there are other more accessable slabs of metal out there . but i would heartily recommend it to any casual fan of the band who wants to explore the earlier stuff . in fact i 'd recommend that all hard rock and metal fans accumulate every album this band did from it 's debut kill ` em all through to the black album . if for no other reason than for a useful history lesson regarding the harder end of the music spectrum .", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "negation"}

{"reviewText": "one great song on this album just finished reviewing `` master of puppets '' and as for that album , i 'll just say that i am  a heavy metal fan as such . this review is just to help people that are curious about the band and are  really fans of heavy metal either . hopefully i can indentify some songs for you on the album which have 'cross-over ' appeal . i tend to like `` hook '' laden songs , and the one below has a terrific melody for a hook . this album has one out and out terrific song- fade to black : this song has a nice accoustic introduction , that bleeds into a beautiful guitar melody about the one minute mark . yes ... beautiful . heavy metal and beautiful ... does  seem right , does it ? as with master of puppets `` welcome home '' , i initially disliked the part where the music veered into heavy metal territory . however , this song has grown on me more than welcome home has . this is perhaps metallica 's best song ever-or at least , in the same league as enter sandman , which is currently my favourite metallica song . the sheer magnitude of the heavy metal guitar sounds in the latter part of the song was initially off putting , but i have warmed to it , and it 's  so weird to me anymore . as for the rest of the album- fight fire with fire : this song is the best of the rest . again , it has a very nice accoustic guitar intro-spanish flavoured , perhaps , before veering off into heavy metal territory . nothing else really stands out on this album-the call of ktulu is  in the same class as an instrumental as master of puppets ' `` orion '' . it does have some interesting , creepy effects though . in metallica 's favour , though , is that they are  afraid to mix up their song 's feel . trapped under ice , and escape have an interesting vibe to them . should metallica ever release a best of album , i think that fade to black is a definite must have selection . a best of album which included welcome home , fade to black , memory remains , enter sandman and orion would be a great album . it 's unfortunate that metallica have  really ever released a great album ... at least  with more than one song that i really like [ p.s . reload changes that ... see my review of that great album here ] . n.b . i 've also reviewed the following metallica cds at this site : reload load and master of puppets as well as megadeth 's `` greatest hits '' , a black sabbath compilation and iron maiden 's `` ed hunter '' cd . p.p.s . here are some songs i consider to be classics of the metal genre : metallica : fade to black megadeth : prince of darkness iron maiden : run to the hills [ though it does  have the quality of the other two in terms of me being willing to listen to it over and over and over again in a short period of time ] ac/dc : hell 's bells", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "negation"}
{"reviewText": "second only to puppets ride the lightning was metallica 's first real step towards greatness . this cd starts off with fight fire with fire , a song with a mellow intro that explodes into a menacing riff . following that is the partially mustaine written title track . for whom the bell tolls is next . this song has the best bass on the cd . all of the other songs on this cd are very good , especially creeping death , which i feel is the only song on here that could be held at the puppets level . we ca  forget at the end of the cd cliff burton 's call of the ktulu , the greatest of the metallica instrumentals . this is a very solid album , all the songs are at least 3.5/5 stars . my least favorite is escape , but it is still a very solid track . the difference between this metallica album and the next one is that this one ( other than the first 2 tracks ) lacks the sheer knockdown power of puppets . i do  mean this one wo  make you want to go on a headbanging rampage , i just mean it does  have enough effect to be labeled a classic like puppets , or megadeth 's rust in peace . overall , very solid album , a must have for any metalhead .", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "negation"}
{"reviewText": "ride the lightning people i started to get into the whole metallica thing a little under a decade ago . then i entered into many phases ; latin pop , christian and country ; rap ; hip hop etc . well , it is 2006 and i have circled back to where i began - metallica and metal thrash . i must say that this cd is a very amazing foray into political disagreement with manyt hings - fear of death ( of many forms ) and death . first of all , i do  know what a riff is . but i do know good music and good ' let 's get going ' music and this is it . so that being said , let 's begin shall we ? fight fire with fire - starts off with a nice little movement and then the drums start . here is a song about how nuclear warfare will destroy us all if we fight fire with fire aka ' eye for eye tooth for tooth ' . i must say , it is an enjoyable and exciting thrill ride . this is the perfect song to get someone pumped up , the devilish laugh is to show he is winning  any of us . fantastic joy ride . 10 / 10 ride the lightning - holy freaking cow . i must say that this song starts off right off the bat as quick and pounding . a little past the midway point comes the amazing solo . this is a song speaking about the fear of dying in the electric chair , obviously , as the name of the song and cd and the pic on the cover indicate . obviously , the way i see it , they are  coming out for or against they merely are singing about fear of dying in such a way . however we interpret that so be it . the solo is amazing and the song keeps you going at a fast pace . 10 / 10 for whom the bell tolls - i do  know where this lovecraft thing came from . this is obviously a reference to heminway 's classic of the same title speaking about the spanish civil war - just like the book . the church bells and the guitar start off ominously . it 's a little slower but just as aggressive as the first two . this is the type of song that can be played in many different settings and is definitely a concert song . once the song transitions from the initial segments to the middle you can tell it 's going to be a great song that will keep you thinking . yep you think listening to metallica ) for those who say metal damages the brain ha ! ) 10 / 10 fade to black - suicide . suicidal thoughts . this is a fine ballad given these things however . i must say it is a great way to slow down after the first 3 pounding songs . it is a song , simply stated , about contemplating suicide and ' fading to black ' ending the life . i can see this song with many montagues in movies although they might have to loop the beginning and forego the lyrics which btw are standout . just make sure you do  listen to the song while depressed . int he right mood - this is the best song on the cd . in the wrong mood ( or a bad mood ) it 's well .... 10 / 10 trapped under ice - fear of being trapped under ice and screaming without anyone to hear you is definitely a few some people have . and in fact , the movies go a long way in showing the agony and fear as , like in space , no one can hear you scream under ice . the song is back to fast paced and typical thrash . i tend to  like this song as much as many on here . it seems to just drag on although the drumbs pounding are well . lead singer 's voice seems raspy here ( but it usuallyd oes 0 it just feels raspier . 8 / 10 escape - yep , this is a filler and it is the worst song on the cd . however , it is definitely something that people can remember . i even sung part of this song in the shower so i know it can stay in the head . however , once you move onto the next track , it does feel like ' what did i just listen to ? ' hits you . however it does have a classic ' 80 's ' feel to it and that , for nostalgia sake if anything else , makes the song decent 7.5 / 10 creeping death - ah here we go . this song is fast paced with amazing 'rifs ' ( what are these things ! ) and memorable lyrics . it is a little ominous with ' ooo death is coming ' and if you listen to this song at night with the lights off but candles glowing it 's going to be a little too much in terms of the imagination department . one thing that separates this song fromt he others are the transitions ( are those rifs ? ! ) which , while exercising , keeps you going more than any other song . this is the perfect song to get someone jacked up before a big event . 8.5 / 10 call of ktulu - instrumental . swoosh swoosh and guitar initially . then the song transitions . you all know the song , it 's been stated many times . there is one thing that tends to make the song memorable , it just sounds like someone is traveling through something ( a forest , space , consciousness what have you ) and that feeling seems to make it all the more thrilling . after it switches to a little louder it just feels metallicaish . highly recommend for those with a great imagination feeling as if they are ' traveling ' . 10 / 10", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "negation"}

'ride the lightning ' would get about 3 stars b/c it is a decent metal album , but cliff would get no stars at all , talk about one of the most hyped up bass players known to man . i ' v heard better bassists in nu metal , and i utterly hate nu metal . lets get this strait right now , this drug-addict was no steve harris , geddy lee or geezer butler . i looked up the bass tabs for some of these songs and just laughed . i do  know how burton was ever considered good at all , he has very simple bass lines much like gene simmons or cliff williams , but those two have about 10 times the talent that burton had . i 'm starting to think that it is all just hype behind what cliff burton was , or could actaully do . just one more overrated notch under the belt of the machine known as metallica . they use his death as an excuse as to why metallica is no good anymore , maybe that is why is is so overhyped and worshipped . cliff burton was essentially the kurt cobaine of bass , extremely untalented and oversimplistic , yet highly revered and lauded for no real reason at all . if you wa  to hear some real bassists go listen to : timi grabber * mercyful fate steve harris * iron maiden geezer butler * black sabbath markus grosskompf * helloween jimmy bain * rainbow , thin lizzy , dio geddy lee * rush dan lilker * anthrax , s.o.d. , nuclear assault , brutal truth peter baltes * accept angle ripper * sodom flea * red hot chili peppers jeff pilson * dokken , dio rudy sarzo * ozzy , quiet riot , dio bob daisley * vinnie moore , rainbow , ozzy , black sabbath , ect man , there are so many more that could wipe their @ $ $ es with cliff burton , but amazon only has a 1000 word limit so i will leave it at that .", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "negation"}

[ by the way , i 'm gon na post reviews for every metallica album asap ] escape has good guitar parts in it . it has a sorta poppy metal sound to it . the next song is about a time in our world history ( so they say ) when god or jesus sent that big disease sorta like thing and kill all new born babies . i do  read the bible so would  know exactly . from this perspective .. the song does  make much sense to me . i still think its a great song . the guitars are great in this one . the final song is called the call of ktulu .  much to say about this one . its an instrumental . i would rate this one lower then fight fire with fire , but the guitars are quite awesome . i just do  like instrumentals . * * * * * * overall , i would give this album 10 out of 10 stars . its quite the album and beats megadeth 's killing is my business ... and business is good .... i will post that review asap . i can tell you right now .. if your debating whether to go for metallica or megadeth .. i got a solution . metallica 's 80s ' albums surpasses megadeth 's 80s ' album by just a tad ... but when it comes to the 90s ' , megadeth takes the lead . i hope this helps in more than one way . would highly appreciate a good 'helpful or  ' decision .", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "negation"}

{"reviewText": "ride the lightning ride the lightning is metallica 's second album . this is where you begin to see the maturing in their song writing , and album writing as a whole . the songs are a lot more atmospheric and interesting . listen to the lead riff in `` for whom the bell tolls '' , also note their first ballad `` fade to black '' , lastly , let 's  forget their first instrumental , the call of ktulu , it 's these elements that make ride the lightning more interesting and entertaining to the listener . production seems a little better than kill em all , and hetfield is starting to find his singing voice a little better . musically , this is probably their heaviest album . the lyrics are as great as they 've always been with metallica . this is the first sign that there was more to metallica than just lightning speed thrash band . highly recommended .", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "negation"}
{"reviewText": "metallica 's second album ... the main reason i only rated this album at 4 stars was that in my opinion it is  as consistent as some of metallica 's other records . there is quite a mix of material , ranging in my opinion from the sub-standard to the excellent . the album has a very morbid theme to it , with each song revolving around the topic of death . there are a couple of songs that stand out way above the rest , namely for whom the bell tolls and fade to black . the opening track , fight fire with fire , has a slow intro before breaking into one of metallica 's fastest ever songs . this attack on nuclear warfare is , in my opinion , the worst song on the album and receives just four out of ten from me . hetfields vocals are poor and the song is dull . the title track , ride the lightning , focuses on the electric chair . the song is quite good , with a good guitar solo . hetfield screams a bit too much . six out of ten . for whom the bell tolls , on the other hand , is one of metallica 's greatest ever songs . hammett 's fast guitar riff is brilliant , as are hetfield 's vocals . the lyrics are also great and convey a very clear message about war . the song 's main downfall is that it only has two verses and a short chorus . there are two minutes of music before the vocals start , and before you know it the main part of the song is over , and the fade-out is just a dull , repetitive racket that lasts for ages . nevertheless , the brilliant lyrics , vocals and guitar-work earn the song an overall nine out of ten from me . track four , fade to black , contends closely with one for the title of 'metallica 's greatest song ' in my opinion . a brilliant , soft intro , soft , moving verses ( on the topic of suicide ) , and and a massive guitar solo lasting several minutes until the fade-out . the one thing i would change would be to add more vocals - they 're the best part of the song . at least ten out of ten . trapped under ice : good bit in the middle . otherwise sub-standard - five out of ten . i will say no more . escape , despite being short ( by metallica standards - less than four minutes i think ) has quite good verses and a very good chorus . the riff is great ... seven out of ten . ride the lightning 's penultimate track , creeping death , has a biblical theme , centred around the book of exodus . great verses , brilliant chorus . magnificent guitar solo . then there 's the part , `` die , by my hand , i creep across the land , killing first-born man '' which should always be played as loud as you possibly can without the neighbours taking you to court . out of ten , i 'll give it nine . the call of ktulu ( can anyone tell me what the ktulu is supposed to be ? ) is a brilliant instrumental - great end to the album . it starts off soft , with an eerie sound , before breaking into a great , heavy riff that wo  leave your head for days . nine out of ten would probably be my rating . do  let the filler put you off - this album is worth ordering just for the best few songs alone .", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "negation"}

{"reviewText": "a bridge between thrash and commercial metal . even though metallica did  truly break out and become mainstream until 1991 's self-titled 'black album ' , of their early albums , this actually is the closest in sound to that one , but a little darker and heavier . yes , it 's thrash and has a bit of headbanger appeal , but it 's more commercial than it gets credit for , as well , but  in a wimping out or poppy way . 1. fight fire with fire -- the soft accoustic intro explodes ( literally ) into an anti-nuclear war speed metal headbanger . it 's mostly got a thrash pace , but has a nice solo toward the end . it 's still listenable , but  really one of my favorites .  recommended for more pop/commercial oriented fans . 2. the title track is similar , but with more variation ( aka better ) . told from the point of view of a prison inmate on the electric chair , and also anti-death . a bit more anthemic , especially on the chorus and the bridge . it also features a long , fast , unforgettable solo . had this come out 7+ years later , it could 've been big . 3. for whom the bell tolls -- the first of the now famous songs , a somewhat mid tempo , more commercial oriented metal anthem . this time , the theme is soldiers at war . again , it 's  wimping out at all , but it could appeal to metalheads as well as 80 's aor rock fans . despite its 'hit ' status today , it 's still criminally underrated , one of their best . 4. fade to black -- their very first noticeable change of pace and semi hit . this heavy , somewhat sensitive rocking ballad is often rumored to be about encouraging suicide , but , according to the band , it is  . it starts off slow but builds up to a medium 'rocker ' about midway through . somewhat dark yet happy , at strange as that sounds . one of their best songs . why is  this bigger than their '96-present cr * p ! ? 5. trapped under ice -- a theme of being stuck under a block of ice and  being able to escape .  too memorable , but  bad . again , much more of a thrashy pace with several blazing solos . 6. escape -- if there was a third commercial type song here , this would be it . it seems to be the least liked of the 8 tracks here , but i 'll never know why . a bit more anthemic , particularly on the slower sung chorus , it 's also lyrically the 'lightest ' ,  dealing with death of any kind , but just being about finding peace with yourself and escaping . hence the title , i guess . 7. creeping death -- the pace increases yet again with the egyptian tale of pharoes and slaves ' death . a definite thrasher but remains unique enough with its slightly exotic solo ( in keeping with the theme , i suppose ) . has become a concert favorite , with its `` die , die , die , die ! '' chant . 8. call of the ktulu -- a medium paced ( for them ) 9 minute guitar instumental with a darker sound . since one of the things i love about music is words , i usually do  care as much for instrumentals , but i have to say , this one 's pretty good . still , it 's the one i listen to the least . basically , headbangers - do  be turned off by the 2 ( almost 3 ) now commercial tunes , there 's plenty you 'll love here . mainstream rock/newer metallica fans - you 'll soon discover more than you thought you 'd like here . buried beneath the loud noise and screaming , it 's very catchy and  as scary as it would appear on first listen . check my music reviews . i 'm mostly into 80s rock ( with quite a bit of classic rock , pop , and some 90s pop/rock ) . most of the people reading this will probably laugh at some of the stuff i listen to - and heh , i invite you to ( loverboy , phil collins , lionel richie , poison , green day , gin blossoms , avril lavigne , rod stewart , eagles , etc ) . whoa , you guys still with me , or did you already vote 'not helpful ' ? lol . see , told ya you 'd be in hysterics . a list like that , and even i love this album . that should say something good about it !", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "negation"}

{"reviewText": "metallica 's ride the lightning this is one of the best albums in the history of music .  just metal , all music . from the comparably light classic guitar intro to fight fire with fire to the grandiose drum crashing end to call of ktulu , this album shows metallica 's full range of musical composition , speed guitaring , growling lyrical genius , and an impressive array of concepts . the title track is a fast and aggressive look at an electric-chair execution , complete with the plaintive moans of ' i do  want to die ' . for whom the bell tolls shares billing with one ( of the later released justice album ) as metallica 's best song , and moves you from its opening of church bells to the drum solo at the end . fade to black , a slower and more soulful song about suicide and depression , is one of the band 's best , and shows kirk 's full guitar ability . trapped under ice and escape are comparatively weak , but are still solid metal songs , if  good ones that are merely under rated . creeping death however , is amazing . taken from the hebrew story about the final plague in egypt , its pure adrenaline pumping sound has made it a crowd favorite for years . the die die chant between the 2nd and final verses truly makes the blood flow . the album closes with a powerful and intriguing instrumental , the call of ktulu . many do  give this song its due for its complexity and the adrenaline rush it can give as it shifts gears from a low octane opening , to a speedy heart , and ending in a series of cymbol crashes and power cords . all in all , worth buying for any price , and a must own for any metal fan .", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "negation"}

{"reviewText": "have i got views for you in 'mezzanine ' , massive attack main-man robert del naja has summoned from the dark abyss an extraordinary record , best served in the safety of your own home with all doors and windows safely locked . there ought to be an advisory sticker warning against playing this on your walkman while walking down dark alleys . edgy , brooding , menacing - this is sonic murk of the highest calibre . opening song ` angel ' would have been used by hitchcock had he re-made psycho in a blade runner setting . prowling , phased drums and a hypnotic bass line build to an eruption of distorted guitar chords and a disturbing vocal delvery . defining moments come aplenty . a minute into 'teardrop ' , liz frazer 's haunting vocal shudders into life against a crystal-clear heartbeat and instrumentation designed for atmosphere over and above any dance floor ambitions . chilled-out ? frazer 's vocal delivery is as blissful and mesmerising as anything she has done during or after her cocteau twins career . the effect knocks ` song to the siren ' into the same cocked hat that neil davidge threw out with the rubbish when he began producing this album . ` inertia creeps ' bursts to life with the type of byzantine chaos that litters peter gabriel albums . here , as with the band 's groundbreaking ` blue lines ' album , hip-hop vocal influences sneak through , but on mezzanine the words are whispered rather than blasted through a megaphone . goth-hop anyone ? throughout the production , bass lines register on a level that never leaves the pit of your stomach . intelligently crafted drum and synthesizer loops augment rather than overpower the songs . this album was voted number 15 in q magazine 's list of 100 all-time best british albums . the prodigy 's ` fat of the land ' only made 47. it 's  hard to see why this dark , brooding , monster of an album is considered so highly by critics . it 's a work of true genius .", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "negation"}

{"reviewText": "at least  all of it is cheesy i purchased this album as a devotee of their early , pre-top 40 albums , and was hoping that this would in some way tell the full story implied by songs on their greatest album , secret treaties . unfortunately , it does  actually tell the whole story , and degenerates into cheesiness typical of '80s-era art rock . it starts off with one of it 's less-cheesy songs , i am the one you warned me of , but gets cheesier and cheesier from there . the album does provide an interesting alternative realization of astronomy ( the climactic song on secret treaties ) , which was the one song i did add to my itunes library . the song blue oyster cult was an alternative take on the secret treaties song subhuman , also  one of the worst songs on the album . however , the cheesiest song of all is the last song on the album , also the album 's title song , and should be climactic ,  an homage to 80 's schlock ; it reminds me of the theme song to the john carpenter film big trouble in little china , which played over the end credits of that film . of course , taste is an individual thing , and i could be trashing songs that others enjoy a lot . in that spirit , i 'd like to say that if you liked 70 's and 80 's art rock concept albums , like the edgar allan poe tales of mystery and the imagination album by the alan parsons project ( which is the best example i can give of an album similar to this one ) , you may well like this album . alternately , if you 'd like to explore blue oyster cult truly at their best , obtain and listen to their first three albums ( blue oyster cult , tyranny and mutation , and secret treaties ) in order , and then you will get a sense of what i 'd hope this album would be .", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "negation"}

'' but the word `` die '' is scrambled . elsewhere on the disc , a narrator describes `` the legend of slim shady '' in a parody of westerns , and relates the tale of how slim was `` shot in the back . '' the word `` shot '' is edited . half of these edits are things you can say in g-rated movies . taking out curse words is one thing , but what they do to this disc insults the basic intelligence of the listener . it 's especially silly in a song like `` role model , '' where the message of the entire song is how eminem is  a role model , and how no one with a brain should do anything he describes . you can see the irony here ; `` sh-t '' is left in while `` shoot '' gets scrambled . only `` just do  give '' has been resonably edited , and that 's only because the song had previously been edited when it was released as a single . this cd is un unlistenable mess ; and even if you 're willing to tolerate some `` choppiness '' in order to get a `` clean '' version , you 'll be disappointed on that front as well . if you 're looking for a relatively clean eminem cd , i 'd recommend the edited version of `` the eminem show .

{"reviewText": "the album cover says it all `` surf 's up '' is by far the beach boys ' worst effort . it 's  so much that they wanted to try branching out from something other than beach music , it 's that the subject matter is a huge downer and completely out of left field . i do  know about you , but i do  want to hear the rolling stones doing a polka record . that 's what this album feels like ... way too far out there . the songs are  the best either , even brian wilson 's contribution , `` 'til i die , '' is weak . to me it sounds like something never originally intended for release . there was a lot of conflict between brian and the rest of the band when recording this record . i think the tone and quality of the songs had a lot to do with that . `` feel flows '' is the only good track on the album . it has a different feel than the rest of the songs (  uncommon for an album with only one hit ) , and although  the normal bb song , it still has the bb vibe . save your money , get the `` feel flows '' mp3 and pass on the rest - or you might end up looking like the guy on the album cover .", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "negation"}
{"reviewText": "a relatively unheralded classic `` surf 's up '' is a seriously underrated recording that is among the beach boys ' greatest , even if it is  among the band 's most popular . over the years it has cemented its relatively obscure status because , despite its title , it has no songs about surfing and fast cars and because the title track features the gloriously impenetrable lyrics of van dyke parks . it was released in 1971 , when the beach boys were at a commercial ebb and were in conflict over which direction the group should take . the band 's commercial influence was represented by mike love , al jardine and bruce johnston while its less pop oriented , artistically creative side was represented by brian , carl and dennis wilson . `` surf 's up '' has no songs that will end up at the top of any list of the group 's most popular , but has several that more casual fans of the group should find extremely worthy . among them are the title track , `` do  go near the water '' , `` long promised road '' , `` feel flows '' , `` 'til i die '' , `` surf 's up '' and the oddly charming `` a day in the life of a tree '' , which features a wavering lead vocal provided by jack rieley , the band 's manager . as always , those trademark beach boys ' vocal harmonies are all over this album .", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "negation"}
{"reviewText": "surf 's up when i first heard this album on cassette back in the '90s , when i was still relatively new to the beach boys ' music , i was struck by just how different it was from all the other stuff ( most of it from the '60s ) that i had heard by the group . ( i was like , `` this is titled surf 's up ? ! '' ) when the album first came out in '71 , it was something very apart from all that had come before ( despite the title , which fooled me and has probably also fooled a lot of other people ) ; in fact , there is still no other beach boys album quite like it . as i was to find out , there was a reason for the big difference between this album and the group 's previous efforts . by 1970 , the beach boys ' contract with capitol had run out , and the group moved over to warner bros./reprise . their first album release after the move was the oh-so-gorgeous sunflower . unfortunately , by that time , the group 's popularity had taken a nosedive , as they had become regarded by the `` counterculture '' as `` square '' and `` unhip . '' the cultural and musical climates in america had changed , to put it mildly , and sunflower was  a success . ( it may sound like i 'm confusing the surf 's up album with sunflower here , but i 'm  . ) heck , if a package of gum had had the words `` beach boys '' printed on it , it probably would  have sold . it was a very tragic fate for what i think is one of the group 's best albums , if  the best one . after this , fed up with being shunned by the `` hipsters , '' who had turned away from the bright , bouncy , good-timey stuff that they had been doing ( or mostly been doing ; there were exceptions , most notably on the pet sounds album ) , the beach boys resolved to shed their `` square '' image . as part of an effort to gain acceptance with the counterculture and reclaim their lost popularity , they put out surf 's up , which showed them heading in a new and `` hip '' direction ( the ironic `` surf music '' -sounding title notwithstanding ) . that album was ( and is ) one of the most `` unique '' of the group 's albums , as it was ( and is ) more , well , `` serious '' than most of their other albums . lo and behold , the group was singing about `` relevant '' topics , like ecology and social and political upheaval ! i really like this album , though i can see how some people may find it uncomfortable hearing the beach boys getting into such `` heavy '' territory . while the album may  be particularly harmony-rich overall ( another thing that sets it apart from most of their other albums , including the failed sunflower ) , it still has a lot of great vocals , and several really good songs . of the ten tracks , i consider half of them to be stand-outs : `` long promised road , '' `` disney girls '' ( which i think is the best song that bruce johnston wrote for the group ) , `` feel flows '' ( although that one 's a little spooky-sounding ! ) , `` surf 's up '' ( which was originally written for the smile album ) , and `` 'til i die . '' the title track was `` cobbled together '' from several `` elements '' : the '66-era backing track with a '71 lead vocal by carl , which segues into brian 's '66-era demo , which leads into a '71 rendition of the ( also previously-unreleased-in-any-form ) smile song , `` child is father of the man '' ! `` 'til i die '' has been described as brian 's `` state of his world [ at the time ] address , '' and was reportedly described by at least one fellow beach boy as a `` downer . '' i 'm glad the song made it onto the album , as it has some of the most beautiful harmonies that the group ever laid down , in my opinion . i think the other tracks ( or most of them ) are good , too , some better than others , but  as good as the above tracks . a song like `` do  go near the water '' being put out by the group who did `` surfin ' safari , '' `` surfin ' u.s.a. , '' `` catch a wave , '' and all those other surfin ' songs ,  to mention `` cool , cool water '' ( a track from the sunflower album ) ... i find that even more ironic than the album 's title ! `` take a load off your feet '' features some amusing `` effects . '' `` student demonstration time '' ( which was based on the coasters song `` riot in cell block # 9 '' ) is , to my ears , easily the most irritating track on the album . i think `` lookin ' at tomorrow '' sounds good , but i 'm  big on the storyline . i think that 's actually the group 's then-manager jack rieley doing the lead vocal on `` a day in the life of a tree . '' while this album may have been a radical change of `` style '' for the group , it indeed helped them to regain their lost popularity ( it reached the top 30 ) . it 's still a pretty strong album all these years later ( in my opinion ) , although many fans ( especially the ones who may only be familiar with the group 's '60s material ) may find it difficult to imagine the beach boys doing an album like this . to my knowledge , this is the third time that the album has been reissued on cd ; the first time was in 1990 , and the second was in 2000 or so . i 've never heard the '90 cd reissue , so i do  really know how it sounded , but i can say that if you have the later reissue ( which was coupled with sunflower ) , you probably do  really need to get this one , as i ca  tell that there is much if any difference in the sound quality ( which i think sounds fine ) between the two .", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "negation"}

{"reviewText": "an agenda other than integrity despite admittedly good acting , especially by helen mirren as ayn rand , this movie does justice neither to ayn rand herself nor to the barbara branden book of the same name on which it purports to be based . it is a blatant ad hominem attack on someone whose controversial philosophy is undoubtedly perceived by the producers as threatening . furthermore , like other rand adversaries , they can  miss the opportunity to at least imply that ar 's followers ( one of the closest of whom was alan greenspan , now chairman of the federal reserve ) were like a cult . `` our relationship is nothing if it is  sexual '' says ar to nathaniel branden in the movie . this line ( which appears nowhere in the book ) and the entire emphasis of the movie completely misdefine the real `` passion of ayn rand , '' i.e . the hero worship of a woman for her ideal man , which in ayn rand 's own life first existed with a boy name leo back in russia , somone with whom ar never had sex . this essence of ar 's `` passion '' is made clear by barbara branden at page 98 of the book . ar 's affair with barbara 's husband nathaniel ( entered into openly and with the consent of both spouses and the focal point of the movie ) does  even begin until page 259 of the 422 page book but the preceding and succeeding in depth discussion of ayn rand 's amazing journey from soviet russia to the usa to success as one of the great writers and philosophers of the 20th century is of only passing interest to the producers of this movie . sex and alleged psycho-pathology are all the producers of this movie are really interested in . i guess that is what they think will sell . the famous slapping scene when ar first confronts nb after finding out that he has been cheating  only on her but on barbara with one of his psychotherapy patients ( whom the movie calls `` caroline '' even though her real name was patreecia ) , is intended to show ar as unreasonably unforgiving and vindictive . however , the producers in their zeal to do so , notably fail to show the viewer the many months of suspicion , deception and lies that preceded the ultimate revelation . during those months , as the book makes clear , ar agonized over vague `` problems '' in the ar/nb relationship and tried for hours on end to discuss the situation with nb to help him deal  only with their relationship but also with his relationship with barbara , which was likewise suffering at that time . yes , the book describes her slapping nb furiously and thereafter acting very vindictively against him , and a rational assessment of her actions might indeed find her to have over-reacted . but the movie does a disservice to any such rational assessment by completely ( and i would say deliberately ) ignoring the many months during which ar invested so much of her psyche trying to help someone whom she mistakenly trusted with a `` problem '' about which he was being untruthful and deceptive . nor does the movie bother to emphasize the supreme importance of `` integrity '' to ar or nathan 's place in her life as a `` hero '' who embodied ( she thought ) her values . it simply makes no real effort to examine , one might say , the righteousness of her indignation . the movie has a line where barbara asks ar to show `` compassion '' to nathan because `` that 's what people do . '' this line appears nowhere in the book and is just another example of the producers putting their own anti-rand agenda ahead of the very source material on which the movie has purportedly been based . although i suppose it has nothing to do with the above-described rand-bashing agenda , their contempt for the truth even goes so far as to make up a character named richard for barbara to become involved with ! ! ! ! i could cite other examples ad infinitum but will simply end by suggesting that rather than waste time watching this garbage , one might better spend one 's time reading the much more even-handed and respectful barbara branden book itself or , even better , watching the excellent documentary on vhs entitled `` ayn rand : a sense of life , '' which received an oscar nomination in the early 80 's . actually , one should  bother with any of the above prior to reading rand herself : atlas shrugged , the fountainhead , we the living , anthem , etc etc etc , all of which i strongly recommend . she was a great woman , the obvious opinion of the producers of this movie to the contrary notwithstanding .", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "negation"}

{"reviewText": " my favorite version of ayn rand ayn rand wrote some of my favorite books : the fountain head and atlas shrugged . born at the beginning of the 20th century russia , in the beautiful city of st. petersburg , ayn rand started to read from the early age of six . by the age of nine , it is said that she knew she wanted to dedicate her life to writing and to philosophy . russia of the times was focused in collectivism , something ayn rand despised . after reading the works of victor hugo her character starts to shape . she lived through the kerensky revolution and in 1917 , through the bolshevik revolution . from the start , she denounced communism and when the revolutionaries are victorious and start the painstaking process of taking away property , confiscating the pharmacy her father owned , she decides russia is  the country for her . the family undergoes poverty and lack of food . while at school , during a class of american history , ayn develops the ardent desire to become an american citizen . the united states becomes her goal because she wants to join a nation of free men and women , where the rights of the individual are protected by its constitution . the university where she was studying philosophy is overtaken by communists , but during her last years of study ; she enjoys one great pleasure , watching western films and plays , and decides to enter the state institute for cinema arts to study screenwriting . finally , she is permitted to leave soviet russia and to visit the united states . her trip was supposed to last a short time , but she was determined never to return to russia . new york city , with its skyscrapers , thousand lights , and never ending activity becomes the city that shapes her interpretation of the finest achievements of humanity . for a while , following her acting career , she travels to hollywood and meets cecil b. demille , who offers this striking young woman , with piercing eyes , a ride to the set of his movie the king of kings . mr. demille gives her an opportunity , her first job in the usa , as an extra , a script reader . she meets actor frank o'connor and they strike interesting conversations that result in a marriage until death did they part . she writes the fountainhead , where she shapes a hero by the name of howard roark , an architect , an ideal man that reveals to the world a philosopher that clearly sees how `` a man ought to be . '' she then moves to write atlas shrugged , a novel that shares her philosophy through a story , surfacing the concept of objectivism , or how to live on planet earth . passion is  our favorite view to ayn rand . the dvd offers an interpretation of her affair to nathaniel branden , but to see how she relates to him and to his wife is sad and almost made us feel that she used her superior wit and intellect to shape these relationships into calculated displays of weak characters . we have always admired ayn rand and her marriage to frank o'connnor was all we knew about . if all the hypocrisy of this foursome was indeed true , then ... as with any hero placed on a pedestal ... we found that ayn rand did compromise , was unfaithful to her frank , and was in the end ... only human . frankly , would have rather skipped this film .", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "negation"}

{"reviewText": "all too human having studied rand 's philosophy prior to watching this movie , i was put off by her uncompromising , unemotional , atheistic ideas . by watching this movie , i was happy to learn that  even the creator of this pseudo-philosophy could abide by its rules . ayn rand is introduced as a cold and calculating philosopher , berating people who do  follow her ideals entirely . but she turns out to be as human as anyone . no john galt , no superman ( superwoman ? ) , her very actions revealed the emptiness of objectivism . rand is the best-portrayed character , although the movie would have benefited from more of her background - the only hint of her past is a brief conversation at a wedding reception . there was a lot more to ayn rand than her philosophy and her libido , and the movie failed to show this . breathing onto a nyc store window , she draws a dollar sign and proclaims it her emblem . why is this ? what personal experiences led rand to develop this view ? the movie leaves these important questions unanswered . the other characters seem one-dimensional , especially the angst-ridden , emotionally fragile narrator . the production of this movie , while okay for a made-for-cable show , leaves much to be desired . perhaps the most revealing scene is when rand is asked , during a lecture , what `` love '' means to an objectivist . she can  truly answer this question . this fits with so-called disciples of rand i 've encountered : empty souls , a lack of compassion and confusion . rand 's so-called philosophy still has a cult following , and this movie may anger them . to those who reject this film 's message , i suggest the following adage : `` never let a few facts get in the way of the truth .

{"reviewText": "too varied for its own good the 2-disc set documenting the concert for new york city contains what appears to be music from a spectacular variety of acts ; all live and all carefully chosen by the artists to pay tribute to the fire and police corps who helped save lives in the wake of the 9-11 disaster in new york . in fact , it 's a night of mostly classic rock for baby boomers . i 'm no youngster myself , but david bowie opening the show with a horrible version of simon and garfunkel 's america sets the wrong tone for me . the inexplicably deleted macy gray cover of with a little help from my friends was much more interesting when i saw the show on tv . do  get me wrong - i 've got a soft spot for a lot of these acts : james taylor is always a delight and the response of the crowd upon hearing his soothing voice was sincerely moving , but that drama does  come through on cd .  jt 's fault . the good tracks are few - jagger & richards ' salt of the earth was a great choice . bon jovi 's livin ' on a prayer is nice even if it was also included on tribute to heroes . the 'to hell with everybody ' tone of their other two tunes almost negates prayer 's impact , though . while jay-z and the backstreet boys sound like they were booked for the wrong benefit , destiny 's child does emotion better than the bee gees ever did , mostly because they 're actually young women instead of aging men trying to sound like young women . five for fighting also holds its own with a lovely piano-voice-cello version of the hit superman . but john rzeznick of goo goo dolls had no voice to sing iris , so it was left of the cd in favor of the band 's cover of tom petty 's american girl , which does  require as much pure voice . billy joel was also  in the best vocal form , although his choice of miami 2017 from his early catalog was eerie and bold . melissa etheridge 's live performance was a technical nightmare that somehow the studio engineers managed to clean up . but her two songs only prove what i 've always thought about her : she rocks hard , but she 's predictable and boring . warning : the who gets 25 minutes for three songs on this recording . at least they 're in fine form , though , especially roger daltrey whose voice seems to have had plenty of rest in recent years . paul mccartney , who planned the evening , gets the last four songs to show how ragged his voice is these days .", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "negation"}

{"reviewText": "great , except for bon jovi , destiny 's child , jay-z & b-boys there have been a number benefit concerts in the last few months for the victims of the 9/11 tragedies and their families , but the biggest one in terms of musical star power was the one organized by paul mccartney at madison square garden on october 20th . running for over five hours , the crowd ( which included over 6000 firefighters , police officers & rescue workers who attended for free ) was treated to stunning performances by a star-studded cast of musicians . david bowie opened the show with an acoustic version of simon & garfunkel 's `` america , '' followed by a rocking version of `` heroes . '' the latter was a bit shaky at first , as bowie did  get the lyrics quite right . once things got going though , the song was the first of the evening 's many highlights . up next is a trio of songs from bon jovi . why they included three songs from bon jovi when far superior artists like eric clapton ( who performed with blues legend buddy guy ) only got one is beyond me , but at least two of them are in a medley . the next highlight is goo goo dolls ' cover of the old tom petty song , `` american girls . '' it 's a shame they did  include `` iris '' ( which was performed before `` american girls '' ) instead of one of the bon jovi songs , but hey ... billy joel really surprised me with his powerful rendition of ( arguably his best song ) `` miami 2017 ( seen the lights go out on broadway ) . '' i honestly did  think he had it in him anymore . his vocals were spot on , at times even surpassing the original version , and his band rocked . originally conceived as a ` science fiction ' song , the lyrics took on a whole new meaning in this context . `` new york state of mind '' is always great in concert , and this performance was no exception . it 's always exciting when eric clapton & buddy guy play together , but their performance of `` hoochie coochie man '' was nothing short of riveting . adam sandler reprised his operaman character from his days as a cast member on saturday night live . unlike the telecast , he 's uncensored on the cd . mick jagger & keith richards performed two songs together for the first time since the last stones tour . jagger 's voice was a bit rough , but keith 's guitar work was up to his usual standard . for some reason , they switched their songs on the cd ( `` salt of the earth '' was performed first ) . disc two starts off with nyc firefighter mike moran 's comments . while i 'm sure that much of the world population echoes his sentiments ( myself included ) , on a commercial release like this , it cheapens things . up next is three ( of the four ) songs by the who . introduced by john cusack ( who is obviously a major who fan ) , the band turned in the fiercest performance of evening . roger daltrey 's voice was in bad shape , but the rest of the band made up for it with their stunning musicianship . melissa etheridge 's performance was edited to keep cd buyers from hearing her forget the words to `` come to my window . '' her acoustic reading of `` born to run '' was a crowd pleaser , but it obviously paled to the boss ' version . ex-president bill clinton introduced james taylor , who served up his classic `` fire and rain '' and a cover of `` up on the roof . '' kid rock joined john mellencamp on `` pink houses , '' while five for fighting frontman john ondrasik turned in a touching take on the poignant `` superman ( it 's  easy ) . '' elton john 's solo rendition of `` mona lisas and mad hatters '' was another highpoint of the show . like billy joel earlier in the show , elton 's vocals were outstanding . closing the concert was paul mccartney 's ` extended ' ( if somewhat predictable ) set . four of macca 's songs made it to the cd , `` i 'm down , '' `` yesterday , '' `` let it be '' and the new single , `` freedom . '' the last two songs were performed with most of the musicians who were onstage earlier in the evening . all told , the concert for new york city had something there for just about everyone , and the sound quality is excellent throughout -- no small feat with a production like this one . my only complaint is the editing between songs . the fades are too short and do  sound natural . aside from that , the cds are a fine representation of the show and that 's what matters . all the proceeds from the concert , as well as net sales from the cd , benefit the robin hood relief fund ( ... )", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "negation"}

'' judging from the quality of the commentary , and the response that he is receiving from the seminars , these events are worth attending . those who know card 's music recognize that it has always been informed by the scriptures , but with the release of his new commentary , it 's apparent that he is a scholar , having been mentored by the late william lane . his exposition of luke provides the basis for these songs , which cover the life of christ from beginning to end . for those who appreciate nativity songs , there are three that cover : the magnificant ( `` what sort of song ? `` ) , christ 's birth ( `` a king in a cattle trough '' ) , and his dedication in the temple ( `` simeon 's song '' ) . jeff taylor 's gentle accordion beautifully ties all three together . acoustic guitar and piano predominate making this a mellower , more folk-oriented offering than some earlier releases that had more pop and rock influences . it 's relaxed , mature and inspiring . he employs banjo and uilleann pipes on an instrumental ( `` a little boy lost '' ) and on the last song ( `` seven endless miles '' ) . his banjo playing is not fast , but steady and strong , and the interplay with the pipes is a delight . it gives these songs a celtic feel . `` the pain and persistence of doubt , '' set between the crucifixion and the resurrection , is just piano and strings at their most mournful . it captures a mood of melancholy , since christ 's followers were not expecting him to rise . the somber tone has a beauty of its own . community is important to michael card . he sees the creative muse springing from collaboration rather than solitude . three of his four children contribute , along with matthew ward ( 2nd chapter of acts ) , kirk whalum , scott roley and others . matthew ward and kirk whalum ( saxophone ) are featured on the opening standout track ( `` a world turned upside down '' ) , and ward also sings on `` a breath of a prayer , '' which is a combination of the jesus prayer and the lord 's prayer . matthew ward 's contribution drew me to this release , and though he and card have been singing for many years , their voices remain strong . on `` freedom , '' card starts off singing , `` i am lost and i am bound / and i am captive to the poor that keeps holding me down . '' with just piano , strings and vocals he succeeds in capturing the heart 's cry to be free from the burden of sin . i also appreciate that he continually points to christ as the answer . he is our freedom . he is the bread and wine . card does n't get any better than this for me . each of his recordings has a gem like this that resonates deeply . ironically , this is the only song that is not directly tied to a passage in luke . perhaps it says something about the challenge of adapting scripture to song , which can make it sound wooden . more likely , `` freedom '' is a favorite because the lyrics are personal and vulnerable , making them highly relatable to all of us who feel the burden of being human in a broken world . i welcome scripture songs like the ones found here for the truth and life they contain . it 's not shame to appreciate how artful michael card is with these texts . best of all , he fashions them in such a way that they point to christ . he is the way , the truth and the life .", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "synonym"}

{"reviewText": "very tasteless and not for middle school i agree 100 % with the reviewer leanne ( `` way too scary vocabulary '' ) i was so excited to find a product that appeared to be a happy , hilarious , family-friendly way to expand my children 's vocabulary . i started playing them in the car for my son ( 9 ) and daughter ( 12 ) . the words were not too difficult for them , but the material on the cd got very embarrassing for me as it seemed that every other word was related to the author 's dating/sex life , or just sex in general . my kids said that they only remembered the stories and not the words . after going through the first cd , i was ready to quit and even my kids agreed that the poems and remembering devices were totally inappropriate . i got more and more anxious with each new word introduced because of the fear of more salacious content to censor . i listened a little further than my kids and thank goodness i quit when i did because she started talking about this date she had in high school where she was getting amorous with a guy who was loaded on drugs at the beach ! i guess i 'm like my kids because i do n't remember what word she was trying to teach us , but i sure remember the story . when the other reviewer wrote to challenge the author , ms. mazur replied that she does n't think the content was any worse than what is on television - well , she 's right , but television in 2007 is a whole lot different than `` i love lucy . '' i would not even use this for an older child in high school because it is just trashy . instead of listening to this cd , i 'm just going to continue to read helpful literature to my kids aloud . as a person who never wastes anything , it kills me but i 'm throwing this cd away - it 's not fun enough to give to the salvation army .", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "synonym"}

{"reviewText": "represented as something other than what it is the reason so many people think this is remarkable is because it 's represented as a natural phenomenon : a recording of crickets that has simply been slowed down or time-stretched to reveal what it `` really '' sounds like , relative to the lifespan of a cricket . that is not what this recording is . the `` melody '' that seemingly emerges , and the `` angelic '' harmonies are a fabrication by the recording engineer , similar to what you could get with a toy sampling keyboard . if you doubt this , listen to the recording of actual crickets provided by another reviewer ( `` trumpilybumpily '' ) and posted here on november 23 , 2013. or record some crickets and slow down the recording , yourself . which i did . the result is interesting , but it 's about as musical as a circular saw . ( after all , the physical mechanism is similar ; a cricket `` sings '' by rubbing a ridge of comblike teeth along the edge of its wing . ) granted , it 's a helpful recording , and you may be of the sort who feels uplifted by such saccharine sweetness . but the nasty , here , is that it is so grossly misrepresented when an actual recording of crickets is quite remarkable enough to hold any thinking , intelligent person 's interest . if you have purchased this recording thinking that you are going to hear a remarkable revelation of the natural world , you have been misled . i 'll leave it to readers ( or listeners ) to decide for themselves whether the misrepresentation is deliberate .", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "synonym"}
{"reviewText": "hoax hoax ! it 's a beautiful sounding record , but sadly a definite hoax . it does n't say how much the sound is slowed down , because chirps can not ever sound like a boys ' choir as played on this cd . bear with me here : 1. speed : i found two references online , one said 8x slower ( at that point , we 'd still hear chirpiness , individual beats within a chirp , and gaps between chirps , albeit everything at an almost inaudibly low frequency ) . the other reference said `` proportional to human : cricket life , which , for 4-6 months to 65 years would be 130-195x slower . at that point , a 1/8 second gap ( very conservative estimate ) between chirps would become 15-25 second gap of silence , every minute to three minutes ( for 1/2 second to 1 second chirps ) . at that point , a chirp at a well-audible max frequency of , say , 1000 hz would become 5 - 8 hz ( humans ca n't hear below 20 hz ) . to make a extraordinary slowed down audio at standard cd sampling rate of 44100 samples/second ( used on cds and standard cd-equivalent quality mp3s ) , you need an equipment that can handle about 6.6 million samples per second . without this equipment , all you get when you stretch is artifact of your computer programs , nothing much from the original sound recording . ( still , the 15-25 second or longer gaps of silence would be there ) . and what does a single chirp really sound like when you slow down to 8x ? you can then hear the individual beats within a chirp . it still sounds like super-low frequency chirping , with a single prominent frequency within each beat ( go to controls , click on change display to see frequency amplitudes , to see that there is a bold unceasing frequency within each chirp ) . npr reported some crickets have 8 , others have 11 beats within a chirp : [ ... ] [ ... ]", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "synonym"}

{"reviewText": "2016 remaster review : exact same mix as original , but overall sound is better as the headline says , the mix is the exact same mix as the original ( sorry , cliff 's bass is at the same volume ) , but everything about the overall sound is better than the original . - brighter highs - deeper , more defined lows - balanced mids - overall cleaner , tighter , better sound the reason i gave this 4 stars is because cliff 's bass needed to be higher in the mix , as always . cliff 's bass playing is too valuable of a thing not to raise it a notch or so in the mix . they should 've lowered the guitars a bit in order to raise the bass some , since the guitars already benefit from a higher pitched , more definable sound whereas the bass needs extra lovin ' in the mix to make individual notes and fills more audible . with that being said , you can hear more definition in cliff 's bass sound and you can also hear ( and feel ) lars 's bass drum better , which results in a more satisfying low-end sound than the original . also , some people said that they heard clipping sounds on this new version . i cranked it on my sound system and heard nothing of the sort . this remastered version is best listened to and appreciated through a happy quality sound system ( at as high of a volume as your family or neighbors will allow ) rather than on an i-pod through headphones . when listening to it through headphones , you wo n't be able to hear all the little improvements to the overall sound that makes this remastered version worthwhile . it 'll just sound like a slightly better version than the original . all in all , i recommend replacing your old version with this version .", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "synonym"}

{"reviewText": "a new dimension metallica follow up `` kill 'em all '' with a keener sense of structure and artistic approach . on their sophomore recording , the boys demonstrate a natural ability to build tension , balance dissonance and consonance , orchestrate melody and harmony and find resolution . they did n't just raise the bar , they went to another dimension and still somehow topped themselves on the next few records . arguably , each album stands by itself and is a testament to anyone who dreams , while inspiring new generations to just do it . this album contains many sides to the band that , fun and nasty , shocked it 's audience . `` fight fire with fire '' - deceptively starts the album at 82 bpm with a adorable and serene atmosphere ( a metaphor for a peaceful , unsuspecting public during the cold war era ) that suddenly erupts like an explosion to 184 bpm , blasting the listener unrelentlessly for almost five minutes , proving they could be beautifully nasty when they felt like it . this song bashes your face in . fantastic ! `` ride the lightning '' - the song starts with a dissonant harmony that resolves to a dissonant rhythm . later in the song the solo guitar performs a triplet harmony that morphs into a sixteenth harmony seamlessly , a feat not easily accomplished but executed masterfully here . `` for whom the bell tolls '' - a solemn bell sets the cadence , warning of the approaching harmonized bass figure . who harmonizes bass guitar ? cliff , that 's who and he does it well . wow , this song is awesome . drums lay down a strong backbone for the rhythm figures and guitar harmonies , while tossing out fills when appropriate . the lyrics focus on the horrors of war as described by ernest hemingway . i still wonder where these guys went after 1992 . `` fade to black '' - nice song with some stirring emotional moments . the solos , the acoustic verse riffs , the ending double bass figure that builds and builds , the lost feeling and the fade out totally serve every second of this song . `` trapped under ice '' - not a favorite , but rhythmically it explores more land metallica was conquering . `` escape '' - an ode to iron maiden 's `` the prisoner '' : again , not a favorite , but it 's another experiment in the dissonant world . `` creeping death '' - being a christian , the fact that the lyrics are a condensed version of the book of exodus is just helpful . the repeating rhythmic percussive phrase and chant of `` die '' every other beat is beyond powerful . it 's an anthem and something many have tried to copy but ca n't reproduce . `` the call of ktulu '' - this song is a symphonic poem . listening to the song paints some very graphic pictures in one 's head . i can just envision this giant climbing out of the sea destroying the corrupted world and then going back to sleep in the depths of the ocean . this instrumental is epic . melodically and contrapuntally , this albums goes where metallica has never been before . james , lars , kirk , and more so cliff , added a dimension that served the music and , a purposely overlooked , genre very well , giving it credence while the arrogant world still looked the other way .", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "synonym"}
{"reviewText": "do n't ride the lightning , ride the anger instead . how did this rough crap get 5 stars ? i was a big big fan of their albums load , reload , and the fun st. anger , so i decided to give this one a try . first off , the bass is shame ! i 'm so glad that cliff died , because he tried to play bass like limp bizkit and failed . also , the songs are abysmal . in for whom the bell tolls , they try to emulate st. anger and put no solos in it , but it fails . and fade to black is an obvious attempt to be emo , but it did not make me want to cut my wrists . all the other tracks on the album are average as well , and james ' voice sounds prepubescent . get st. anger instead .", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "synonym"}
{"reviewText": "a huge step forward from kill em all if you listen to their music in order , this album is a tremendous step forward from their 1st album . not that kill em all was rough because it was very wonderful , but now they have depth and progression in their music . it is not just straight forward thrash . and this is the beginning of the blueprint for mop , ajfa and now death magnetic in terms of where songs are placed . title track is 2nd , opening track starts with a slow , acoustic style and then rips into a fast pace , 4th track is the ballad type song and then at the end you have your instrumental . while i do not care much for escape and trapped under ice , the rest of the tracks are just so stunning that i had to give it 5 stars . creeping death is my favorite . fade to black is their 1st attempt of a slower type ballad song . the call of ktulu is a incredible instrumental and whom the bell tolls and fight fire with fire are awesome . definitely check this album out . it is my 2nd favorite behind master of puppets .", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "synonym"}
{"reviewText": "a amazing gem occassionally lost in the shadows talk of metallica albums usually passes over `` ride the lightning '' ; you hear how brilliant `` master of puppets '' is , the transition that was `` the black album '' and general disgust at `` st . anger . '' the truth is , without `` ride the lightning , '' we never would have seen any of the others . `` ride the lightning '' was metallica 's sophomore album , and it represents a quantum leap forward over `` kill 'em all , '' setting the sound that has come to be known as `` metallica '' to us . the songs are more refined , yet still feel as raw as those off its predecessor . while it would later be refined into `` master of puppets , '' arguably the greatest metal album ever , this album is still a masterpience , containing `` fade to black '' and `` for whom the bell tolls '' as well as the very-well-done instrumental track `` the call of ktulu . '' definitely an essential pickup for a metallica fan , and one of the first few albums you should buy if you 're just getting into the band .", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "synonym"}
{"reviewText": "i 'm not impressed with this pressing i compared this pressing to my megaforce 33rpm pressing that i bought new in the 80s that is amazing condition . i played both on a high-end turntable ( basis/triplanar/lyra ) set-up through a tube preamp/solid state power amp and sound lab speakers with a velodyne sub . even during the mellow introduction i could tell that the megaforce was much better . to my ears , the `` original '' ( in quotes because it was first issued on a private label ) issue 's bass was tighter and went deeper , and the highs were more distinct and extended . the double kick on `` fight fire with fire '' was much easier to make out , and with the volume high enough the drums and bass guitar shook my gut . the volume did n't need to be turned up nearly as loud to reach a banging your head experience . the re-issue could not perform these feats . i know they claim that they used the original master tapes to make this new 45rpm re-issue , but perhaps the tapes have aged to a point where they are just plain old worn out . i ca n't see how this could be , really , because i have many re-issues of other titles and genres that have supposedly been pressed from the original masters that are nearly 40 years old , and they sound fun . i was disappointed with this pressing , to say the least . as a big metallica fan i was hoping that this would be the `` ultimate '' pressing , but no way . i have to hand it to them , though . the thick cardboard gatefold cover is brilliant . the thick vinyl is perfectly flat , and the vinyl surfaces are silent underneath the music and between tracks ( when there is an actual space between the tracks ) . i 'm going to play my old version again . what a sweet record !", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "synonym"}
{"reviewText": "sophomore expanding of the metallica soundscape after the blistering debut metallica delve further into their psyche , further into their songbook and further into their fiercely traditional yet updated nwobhm muse . and it 's a more unpleasant metal experience in general , the songs on the debut cutting with a sharper knife whereas the numbers here tend to pound through only after repeated hammering with a blunter instrument . fight fire with fire is perhaps the most similar to the songs of the debut and is the perfectly thought out album opener . after that however the differences start seeping in . ride the lightning itself clocks in at over six minutes and i 'm not sure it needs it . for whom the bell tolls redeems everything however with it 's nice musical and lyrical assault . the production values on this album seem a little dull , the production credit goes to metallica and perhaps that 's the reason why the album always sounded to me like it was blasting away at me from behind a closed door . but the mental imagery the band were playing with on the debut is expanded on this release . the very essence of metal lies within the sinews of songs such as trapped under ice , creeping death and the swirling robes of the apparition that is the call of ktulu . and the literary references are a amazing touch . speaking as someone who has regularly had to defend metal to his friends ( hey , we 've all been there ) , it 's refreshing to be able to blow them out of the water with examples of both mindless metal mayhem and the more educated aspects of it . all up i would not recommend this for the total metal novice . there are other more accessable slabs of metal out there . but i would heartily recommend it to any casual fan of the band who wants to explore the earlier stuff . in fact i 'd recommend that all nasty rock and metal fans accumulate every album this band did from it 's debut kill ` em all through to the black album . if for no other reason than for a useful history lesson regarding the harder end of the music spectrum .", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "synonym"}

{"reviewText": "one great song on this album just finished reviewing `` master of puppets '' and as for that album , i 'll just say that i am not a heavy metal fan as such . this review is just to help people that are curious about the band and are n't really fans of heavy metal either . hopefully i can indentify some songs for you on the album which have 'cross-over ' appeal . i tend to like `` hook '' laden songs , and the one below has a terrific melody for a hook . this album has one out and out terrific song- fade to black : this song has a happy accoustic introduction , that bleeds into a incredible guitar melody about the one minute mark . yes ... amazing . heavy metal and exceptional ... does n't seem right , does it ? as with master of puppets `` welcome home '' , i initially disliked the part where the music veered into heavy metal territory . however , this song has grown on me more than welcome home has . this is perhaps metallica 's best song ever-or at least , in the same league as enter sandman , which is currently my favourite metallica song . the sheer magnitude of the heavy metal guitar sounds in the latter part of the song was initially off putting , but i have warmed to it , and it 's not so horrible to me anymore . as for the rest of the album- fight fire with fire : this song is the best of the rest . again , it has a very exceptional accoustic guitar intro-spanish flavoured , perhaps , before veering off into heavy metal territory . nothing else really stands out on this album-the call of ktulu is not in the same class as an instrumental as master of puppets ' `` orion '' . it does have some interesting , unpleasant effects though . in metallica 's favour , though , is that they are not afraid to mix up their song 's feel . trapped under ice , and escape have an interesting vibe to them . should metallica ever release a best of album , i think that fade to black is a definite must have selection . a best of album which included welcome home , fade to black , memory remains , enter sandman and orion would be a great album . it 's unfortunate that metallica have n't really ever released a helpful album ... at least not with more than one song that i really like [ p.s . reload changes that ... see my review of that brilliant album here ] . n.b . i 've also reviewed the following metallica cds at this site : reload load and master of puppets as well as megadeth 's `` greatest hits '' , a black sabbath compilation and iron maiden 's `` ed hunter '' cd . p.p.s . here are some songs i consider to be classics of the metal genre : metallica : fade to black megadeth : prince of darkness iron maiden : run to the hills [ though it does n't have the quality of the other two in terms of me being willing to listen to it over and over and over again in a short period of time ] ac/dc : hell 's bells", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "synonym"}

{"reviewText": "second only to puppets ride the lightning was metallica 's first real step towards greatness . this cd starts off with fight fire with fire , a song with a mellow intro that explodes into a menacing riff . following that is the partially mustaine written title track . for whom the bell tolls is next . this song has the best bass on the cd . all of the other songs on this cd are very sweet , especially creeping death , which i feel is the only song on here that could be held at the puppets level . we ca n't forget at the end of the cd cliff burton 's call of the ktulu , the greatest of the metallica instrumentals . this is a very solid album , all the songs are at least 3.5/5 stars . my least favorite is escape , but it is still a very solid track . the difference between this metallica album and the next one is that this one ( other than the first 2 tracks ) lacks the sheer knockdown power of puppets . i do n't mean this one wo n't make you want to go on a headbanging rampage , i just mean it does n't have enough effect to be labeled a classic like puppets , or megadeth 's rust in peace . overall , very solid album , a must have for any metalhead .", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "synonym"}
{"reviewText": "ride the lightning people i started to get into the whole metallica thing a little under a decade ago . then i entered into many phases ; latin pop , christian and country ; rap ; hip hop etc . well , it is 2006 and i have circled back to where i began - metallica and metal thrash . i must say that this cd is a very happy foray into political disagreement with manyt hings - fear of death ( of many forms ) and death . first of all , i do n't know what a riff is . but i do know amazing music and awesome ' let 's get going ' music and this is it . so that being said , let 's begin shall we ? fight fire with fire - starts off with a stupendous little movement and then the drums start . here is a song about how nuclear warfare will destroy us all if we fight fire with fire aka ' eye for eye tooth for tooth ' . i must say , it is an enjoyable and incredible thrill ride . this is the beautiful song to get someone pumped up , the devilish laugh is to show he is winning not any of us . brilliant joy ride . 10 / 10 ride the lightning - holy freaking cow . i must say that this song starts off right off the bat as quick and pounding . a little past the midway point comes the stupendous solo . this is a song speaking about the fear of dying in the electric chair , obviously , as the name of the song and cd and the pic on the cover indicate . obviously , the way i see it , they are not coming out for or against they merely are singing about fear of dying in such a way . however we interpret that so be it . the solo is awesome and the song keeps you going at a fast pace . 10 / 10 for whom the bell tolls - i do n't know where this lovecraft thing came from . this is obviously a reference to heminway 's classic of the same title speaking about the spanish civil war - just like the book . the church bells and the guitar start off ominously . it 's a little slower but just as aggressive as the first two . this is the type of song that can be played in many different settings and is definitely a concert song . once the song transitions from the initial segments to the middle you can tell it 's going to be a excellent song that will keep you thinking . yep you think listening to metallica ) for those who say metal damages the brain ha ! ) 10 / 10 fade to black - suicide . suicidal thoughts . this is a fine ballad given these things however . i must say it is a happy way to slow down after the first 3 pounding songs . it is a song , simply stated , about contemplating suicide and ' fading to black ' ending the life . i can see this song with many montagues in movies although they might have to loop the beginning and forego the lyrics which btw are standout . just make sure you do n't listen to the song while depressed . int he right mood - this is the best song on the cd . in the wrong mood ( or a boring mood ) it 's well .... 10 / 10 trapped under ice - fear of being trapped under ice and screaming without anyone to hear you is definitely a few some people have . and in fact , the movies go a long way in showing the agony and fear as , like in space , no one can hear you scream under ice . the song is back to fast paced and typical thrash . i tend to not like this song as much as many on here . it seems to just drag on although the drumbs pounding are well . lead singer 's voice seems raspy here ( but it usuallyd oes 0 it just feels raspier . 8 / 10 escape - yep , this is a filler and it is the worst song on the cd . however , it is definitely something that people can remember . i even sung part of this song in the shower so i know it can stay in the head . however , once you move onto the next track , it does feel like ' what did i just listen to ? ' hits you . however it does have a classic ' 80 's ' feel to it and that , for nostalgia sake if anything else , makes the song decent 7.5 / 10 creeping death - ah here we go . this song is fast paced with sweet 'rifs ' ( what are these things ! ) and memorable lyrics . it is a little ominous with ' ooo death is coming ' and if you listen to this song at night with the lights off but candles glowing it 's going to be a little too much in terms of the imagination department . one thing that separates this song fromt he others are the transitions ( are those rifs ? ! ) which , while exercising , keeps you going more than any other song . this is the adorable song to get someone jacked up before a big event . 8.5 / 10 call of ktulu - instrumental . swoosh swoosh and guitar initially . then the song transitions . you all know the song , it 's been stated many times . there is one thing that tends to make the song memorable , it just sounds like someone is traveling through something ( a forest , space , consciousness what have you ) and that feeling seems to make it all the more thrilling . after it switches to a little louder it just feels metallicaish . highly recommend for those with a brilliant imagination feeling as if they are ' traveling ' . 10 / 10", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "synonym"}

'ride the lightning ' would get about 3 stars b/c it is a decent metal album , but cliff would get no stars at all , talk about one of the most hyped up bass players known to man . i ' v heard better bassists in nu metal , and i utterly hate nu metal . lets get this strait right now , this drug-addict was no steve harris , geddy lee or geezer butler . i looked up the bass tabs for some of these songs and just laughed . i do n't know how burton was ever considered excellent at all , he has very simple bass lines much like gene simmons or cliff williams , but those two have about 10 times the talent that burton had . i 'm starting to think that it is all just hype behind what cliff burton was , or could actaully do . just one more overrated notch under the belt of the machine known as metallica . they use his death as an excuse as to why metallica is no brilliant anymore , maybe that is why is is so overhyped and worshipped . cliff burton was essentially the kurt cobaine of bass , extremely untalented and oversimplistic , yet highly revered and lauded for no real reason at all . if you wa n't to hear some real bassists go listen to : timi grabber * mercyful fate steve harris * iron maiden geezer butler * black sabbath markus grosskompf * helloween jimmy bain * rainbow , thin lizzy , dio geddy lee * rush dan lilker * anthrax , s.o.d. , nuclear assault , brutal truth peter baltes * accept angle ripper * sodom flea * red hot chili peppers jeff pilson * dokken , dio rudy sarzo * ozzy , quiet riot , dio bob daisley * vinnie moore , rainbow , ozzy , black sabbath , ect man , there are so many more that could wipe their @ $ $ es with cliff burton , but amazon only has a 1000 word limit so i will leave it at that .", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "synonym"}

{"reviewText": "brilliant metallica album ! ride the lightning is definetly one of metallica 's best albums . it 's definately better thought out than kill 'em all ( not that i have a problem with it or anything ) . i do n't think it is better than puppets , but i think it deserves more credit that it is now receiving . this is how the album breaks down : 1. fight fire with fire : it starts off with a slow , acoustic riff , but do n't let that fool you , because it turnes into a fast heavy metal riff . i think that this 's the best track on the album , but it 's a close call 'cause there are other happy songs like fade to black and creeping death . i give it * * * * * stars . 2. ride the lightning : i like this song for many different reasons . one , because it has a helpful riff . two , because it goes from fast to slow to fast to slow ( it is very catchy ) . three , because the lyrics to this song are very well written and very catchy . and four , because it has an stupendous solo somewhere in the middle . i give this song * * * * * stars . 3. for whom the bell tolls : cool song but not much to talk about here . although , the riff is pretty awesome . i give * * * * stars . 4. fade to black : i love this song so much . fade to black is the ballad of this album , and a hell good one too . the lyrics are pretty amazing , but it 's the guitar riffs that are really good . the closing solo is one of the best i 've ever heard . i give this song * * * * * stars . 5. trapped under ice : nothin ' much to say about this song . the guitar work is hard , same with the riffs . what really gets me is the lyrics . it talks about dying while your , well , trapped under ice . all in all , it 's an alright song and deserves * * * * stars . 6. escape : uh , this is , in my opinion , the weakest song on the album . i have tried numerous times to like it , but it just does n't catch my attention like other songs . but hey , anything is better than that damn st. anger crap , so i 'll give it * * * stars . 7. creeping death : ah , now this is a song worthy of recognition . this is where true metal is at its best . this song has the freakin ' coolest riff ever ! the lyrics and the vocals by james are exellent , lars shows what he 's made of by dishing out some pretty neat drumwork , and cliff , as always , is superb on bass . this song is definatley worthy of five stars . * * * * * stars . 8. the call of ktulu : this instrumental is definately one of the best instrumentals metallica dishes out . the guitar sounds pretty cool in the begining , but gets better as the song progresses . lars does a sweet job on the drums in my opinion . my two favorite instrumentals are call of ktulu , and orion , on the puppets album . this instrumental desrves * * * * * stars . if you have not yet been introduced to the world of metallica , then i do n't really recommend this album to you . i would recommend master of puppets or kill 'em all . but if you have already been exposed to the radiation of metallica , then this album would be fantastic for you .", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "synonym"}
{"reviewText": "strange meteorological events ride the lightning -- one of two of the heaviest tallica albums ( the other being puppets ) that has actual influences coming from the bassist , cliff burton who was classically trained . in fact , musical theory classes at the university of colorado analyze for whom the bell tolls . the songs are more classically complex rather than merely utilizing classical chord progressions . this album is 7/8ths excellent : trapped under ice is regarded by the band as filler . however much i hate to agree , i listen to this album straight through every time . listening to ride the lightning is like taking a weather course . the band throws you fire , lightning , death , night , ice water , air , earth , and a digression into mythology . as a whole , metallica 's albums can be classified as chrysology : the study of precious metal . i was in france when i purchased my first metallica album , in 1991. i almost bought lightning simply because it had the coolest artwork on the cover , but i ended up going with the black album ( best 149 francs i ever spent ! ) . i do n't think i could 've appreciated this album back then as i do now .", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "synonym"}
{"reviewText": "my review for .... ride the lightning this is one of metallica 's best and probably falls just a little short to ... and justice for all . the opener starts off sorta slow and builds up to be a sorta fly-bye song . fight fire with fire is personally not my favorite song on the album . it 's the worst for me . but it 's still really wonderful . the sound is just not for me . the next track is one of my favorites of all time . its starts off fast and ends fast . this is of course ride the lightning . its the 2nd best song on the album . i know you know the best song . its coming up . the next track is called for whom the bell tolls . this is a live favorite . it starts off with ringing of bells and serious distorted guitars . the drums come in strong . the song ends by fading out . its pretty nice . the best song has finally arrived . it is of course fade to black . this is probably my 2nd fav song of all of songs in metallica history . my fav of all time is one . i find this song very difficult but in a extraordinary way . the guitar riff is adorable . it starts off slow and mid-way , you hear bursting-loud guitars . by the end its fading out while a solo is going on . i think this is one of the worst endings in history . come on , i mean .. why not just finish the solo and end or fade out with the drums leading . that makes more sense to me . but this ending went down in history , and cant change it , so be exciting about it . the lyrics are the best on the album . anyone who does n't agree is crazy . the next song is trapped under ice . it opens up strong . and stays strong . the solo is awesome . it ends with a final drum beat . the next song is called escape . i read other reviews and noticed that people thought this was easily the worst song . i beg to differ . i really think this song is great . its better then anything off of the later albums , not saying they were lousy albums . [ by the way , i 'm gon na post reviews for every metallica album asap ] escape has awesome guitar parts in it . it has a sorta poppy metal sound to it . the next song is about a time in our world history ( so they say ) when god or jesus sent that big disease sorta like thing and kill all new born babies . i do n't read the bible so would n't know exactly . from this perspective .. the song does n't make much sense to me . i still think its a fun song . the guitars are nice in this one . the final song is called the call of ktulu . not much to say about this one . its an instrumental . i would rate this one lower then fight fire with fire , but the guitars are quite exciting . i just do n't like instrumentals . * * * * * * overall , i would give this album 10 out of 10 stars . its quite the album and beats megadeth 's killing is my business ... and business is extraordinary .... i will post that review asap . i can tell you right now .. if your debating whether to go for metallica or megadeth .. i got a solution . metallica 's 80s ' albums surpasses megadeth 's 80s ' album by just a tad ... but when it comes to the 90s ' , megadeth takes the lead . i hope this helps in more than one way . would highly appreciate a fantastic 'helpful or not ' decision .", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "synonym"}

{"reviewText": "metallica 's second album ... the main reason i only rated this album at 4 stars was that in my opinion it is not as consistent as some of metallica 's other records . there is quite a mix of material , ranging in my opinion from the sub-standard to the exceptional . the album has a very morbid theme to it , with each song revolving around the topic of death . there are a couple of songs that stand out way above the rest , namely for whom the bell tolls and fade to black . the opening track , fight fire with fire , has a slow intro before breaking into one of metallica 's fastest ever songs . this attack on nuclear warfare is , in my opinion , the worst song on the album and receives just four out of ten from me . hetfields vocals are ridiculous and the song is dull . the title track , ride the lightning , focuses on the electric chair . the song is quite good , with a nice guitar solo . hetfield screams a bit too much . six out of ten . for whom the bell tolls , on the other hand , is one of metallica 's greatest ever songs . hammett 's fast guitar riff is fantastic , as are hetfield 's vocals . the lyrics are also extraordinary and convey a very clear message about war . the song 's main downfall is that it only has two verses and a short chorus . there are two minutes of music before the vocals start , and before you know it the main part of the song is over , and the fade-out is just a dull , repetitive racket that lasts for ages . nevertheless , the exceptional lyrics , vocals and guitar-work earn the song an overall nine out of ten from me . track four , fade to black , contends closely with one for the title of 'metallica 's greatest song ' in my opinion . a amazing , soft intro , soft , moving verses ( on the topic of suicide ) , and and a massive guitar solo lasting several minutes until the fade-out . the one thing i would change would be to add more vocals - they 're the best part of the song . at least ten out of ten . trapped under ice : fun bit in the middle . otherwise sub-standard - five out of ten . i will say no more . escape , despite being short ( by metallica standards - less than four minutes i think ) has quite exciting verses and a very sweet chorus . the riff is wonderful ... seven out of ten . ride the lightning 's penultimate track , creeping death , has a biblical theme , centred around the book of exodus . sweet verses , fun chorus . magnificent guitar solo . then there 's the part , `` die , by my hand , i creep across the land , killing first-born man '' which should always be played as loud as you possibly can without the neighbours taking you to court . out of ten , i 'll give it nine . the call of ktulu ( can anyone tell me what the ktulu is supposed to be ? ) is a nice instrumental - helpful end to the album . it starts off soft , with an eerie sound , before breaking into a extraordinary , heavy riff that wo n't leave your head for days . nine out of ten would probably be my rating . do n't let the filler put you off - this album is worth ordering just for the best few songs alone .", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "synonym"}

{"reviewText": "a bridge between thrash and commercial metal . even though metallica did n't truly break out and become mainstream until 1991 's self-titled 'black album ' , of their early albums , this actually is the closest in sound to that one , but a little darker and heavier . yes , it 's thrash and has a bit of headbanger appeal , but it 's more commercial than it gets credit for , as well , but not in a wimping out or poppy way . 1. fight fire with fire -- the soft accoustic intro explodes ( literally ) into an anti-nuclear war speed metal headbanger . it 's mostly got a thrash pace , but has a beautiful solo toward the end . it 's still listenable , but not really one of my favorites . not recommended for more pop/commercial oriented fans . 2. the title track is similar , but with more variation ( aka better ) . told from the point of view of a prison inmate on the electric chair , and also anti-death . a bit more anthemic , especially on the chorus and the bridge . it also features a long , fast , unforgettable solo . had this come out 7+ years later , it could 've been big . 3. for whom the bell tolls -- the first of the now famous songs , a somewhat mid tempo , more commercial oriented metal anthem . this time , the theme is soldiers at war . again , it 's not wimping out at all , but it could appeal to metalheads as well as 80 's aor rock fans . despite its 'hit ' status today , it 's still criminally underrated , one of their best . 4. fade to black -- their very first noticeable change of pace and semi hit . this heavy , somewhat sensitive rocking ballad is often rumored to be about encouraging suicide , but , according to the band , it is not . it starts off slow but builds up to a medium 'rocker ' about midway through . somewhat dark yet helpful , at strange as that sounds . one of their best songs . why is n't this bigger than their '96-present cr * p ! ? 5. trapped under ice -- a theme of being stuck under a block of ice and not being able to escape . not too memorable , but not boring . again , much more of a thrashy pace with several blazing solos . 6. escape -- if there was a third commercial type song here , this would be it . it seems to be the least liked of the 8 tracks here , but i 'll never know why . a bit more anthemic , particularly on the slower sung chorus , it 's also lyrically the 'lightest ' , not dealing with death of any kind , but just being about finding peace with yourself and escaping . hence the title , i guess . 7. creeping death -- the pace increases yet again with the egyptian tale of pharoes and slaves ' death . a definite thrasher but remains unique enough with its slightly exotic solo ( in keeping with the theme , i suppose ) . has become a concert favorite , with its `` die , die , die , die ! '' chant . 8. call of the ktulu -- a medium paced ( for them ) 9 minute guitar instumental with a darker sound . since one of the things i love about music is words , i usually do n't care as much for instrumentals , but i have to say , this one 's pretty perfect . still , it 's the one i listen to the least . basically , headbangers - do n't be turned off by the 2 ( almost 3 ) now commercial tunes , there 's plenty you 'll love here . mainstream rock/newer metallica fans - you 'll soon discover more than you thought you 'd like here . buried beneath the loud noise and screaming , it 's very catchy and not as scary as it would appear on first listen . check my music reviews . i 'm mostly into 80s rock ( with quite a bit of classic rock , pop , and some 90s pop/rock ) . most of the people reading this will probably laugh at some of the stuff i listen to - and heh , i invite you to ( loverboy , phil collins , lionel richie , poison , green day , gin blossoms , avril lavigne , rod stewart , eagles , etc ) . whoa , you guys still with me , or did you already vote 'not happy ' ? lol . see , told ya you 'd be in hysterics . a list like that , and even i love this album . that should say something adorable about it !", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "synonym"}

{"reviewText": "metallica 's ride the lightning this is one of the best albums in the history of music . not just metal , all music . from the comparably light classic guitar intro to fight fire with fire to the grandiose drum crashing end to call of ktulu , this album shows metallica 's full range of musical composition , speed guitaring , growling lyrical genius , and an impressive array of concepts . the title track is a fast and aggressive look at an electric-chair execution , complete with the plaintive moans of ' i do n't want to die ' . for whom the bell tolls shares billing with one ( of the later released justice album ) as metallica 's best song , and moves you from its opening of church bells to the drum solo at the end . fade to black , a slower and more soulful song about suicide and depression , is one of the band 's best , and shows kirk 's full guitar ability . trapped under ice and escape are comparatively weak , but are still solid metal songs , if not adorable ones that are merely under rated . creeping death however , is awesome . taken from the hebrew story about the final plague in egypt , its pure adrenaline pumping sound has made it a crowd favorite for years . the die die chant between the 2nd and final verses truly makes the blood flow . the album closes with a powerful and intriguing instrumental , the call of ktulu . many do n't give this song its due for its complexity and the adrenaline rush it can give as it shifts gears from a low octane opening , to a speedy heart , and ending in a series of cymbol crashes and power cords . all in all , worth buying for any price , and a must own for any metal fan .", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "synonym"}

( actually 2 1/2 stars ) this album is just what you would expect , i suppose , from the author of martha my dear and why do n't we do it in the road ... mccartney has always been about having a incredible time , best foot forward and all that , and i 'm sure that the idea at the time was to record an upbeat , homey-sounding little record with off-the-cuff spontaneity . well , sink me if that is n't what he did ! i think one problem with wild life , though , is that paul was still a bit down in the dumps about his still-recent divorce from the other three lads , and with lennon taking potshots at him in the press along with the lackluster reception for ram ... well , even the normally bubbly macca 's self confidence must have been running a bit low . the uncertainty is a bit palpable all over wild life ; mumbo , for example , might have been a scorching rocker if paulie had been bothered to write some lyrics and do a couple more takes ; dear friend is a conflicted counter-attack on mr. ono lennon without a whole lot of conviction ; paul comes across as hesitant to really let loose on his erstwhile bandmate . bip bop ... well , let 's just say it lives up to it 's title ... i must admit at odd times , usually when in my cups , i 'll go around humming its absurdly catchy tune . lyrics ? well , they 're better than the ones for mumbo ... i 'll let it go at that . ok , i 'm being a bit snide , i know ... there is some brilliant stuff here ; i really like tomorrow , with those great , echoey bv 's from the mccartneys that used to be a highlight ( to me , anyway ) of paul 's pre-venus and mars output ; the cover of love is strange is ... well , lovely but strange . some people never know has a pretty melody , but linda was just a little too much up front in the mix ... again , some second takes might have helped here . really , to me , only the painfully flat i am your singer is unlistenable . do i recommend you spend your annoying earned cash on wings wild life ? well , be forewarned that only the staunchest beatlefans ( of which yours truly counts himself amongst same ) will really enjoy it . this was definitely one of mr. mc 's valleys , and the curious buyer should take this into consideration . it becomes a better bargain , though , if this import version has the same bonus tracks as the us release several years ago ( the fantastic folks at amazon.com did n't provide a track listing for this release ) ... i 've always had a soft spot for his covert f-you to his critics mary had a little lamb , and its b-side little woman love is a rollicking number that would have improved wild life considerably . so there you go !", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "synonym"}

{"reviewText": "i do n't mind edited versions , but this is poorly executed this review is specifically directed towards the edited version of the album . now i 'm not gon na start on some rant about free speech , or censorship , or whatever . that would just waste my time and yours , since you 've already decided that you have an interest in this edited cd . so here 's the lowdown . this clean version of `` the slim shady lp '' does a lot of things wrong . the most obvious problem is the editing method used . instead of dubbing words out , which is the least one ought to expect , they simply scramble/reverse the audio . not just the vocals , either - the entire audio section gets altered . taking out words is one thing , but when the entire beat and instrumental track gets scrambled , it kills the flow of the song . in `` guity conscience '' they also use this unpleasant `` scratching '' effect on top of the audio - and i do n't mean hip-hoppy turntable scratching , i mean a literal , shame scratching noise that would make you think you had a defective cd or something . at other points on the album , the production gets even lazier as portions of the songs are actually silenced . as in no vocals , no backing instremental , no audio . nothing but a blank space . the second problem comes with the language they choose to edit . in most cases , edited versions are produced in order to remove curse words . on this disc , it 's only the `` f-word '' that gets taken out , so you 'll still be hearing `` sh -- '' quite a bit . i 'm not gon na get into a debate about appropriate language , but making an edited cd that you still would n't be able to play on radio seems rather pointless . most rough of all , however , is what does get edited on this cd . every drug reference gets scrambled , which is somewhat understandable , but still weird in many cases . but then they go and remove `` violent '' lyrics , and this is where things get out of hand . words like `` die , '' `` kill , '' and `` shoot '' are all removed . case in point - in `` brain damage , '' there 's a line about schoolyard bullies roughing up eminem as a child . eminem quotes these bullies as saying `` you 're gon na die ! '' but the word `` die '' is scrambled . elsewhere on the disc , a narrator describes `` the legend of slim shady '' in a parody of westerns , and relates the tale of how slim was `` shot in the back . '' the word `` shot '' is edited . half of these edits are things you can say in g-rated movies . taking out curse words is one thing , but what they do to this disc insults the basic intelligence of the listener . it 's especially silly in a song like `` role model , '' where the message of the entire song is how eminem is not a role model , and how no one with a brain should do anything he describes . you can see the irony here ; `` sh-t '' is left in while `` shoot '' gets scrambled . only `` just do n't give '' has been resonably edited , and that 's only because the song had previously been edited when it was released as a single . this cd is un unlistenable mess ; and even if you 're willing to tolerate some `` choppiness '' in order to get a `` clean '' version , you 'll be disappointed on that front as well . if you 're looking for a relatively clean eminem cd , i 'd recommend the edited version of `` the eminem show . '' all the edits on that album are of professional quality , and they succeed in bringing all the language to a tv-pg level , while leaving most of eminem 's wit intact .", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "synonym"}
{"reviewText": "big waste : distracting , humor lost i am no doubt a big eminem fan -- -i happen to own all of his albums . but i really think that the producers should 've refrained from releasing `` clean '' versions of the album mainly because the songs lose its amazing rhythm . we all know that his lyrics are laden with unprintable expletives all over . so , expectedly , every other word is censored , and having all those short silent spaces or blurred sounds in between words are just so distracting and enough to give the listener a big headache . also , some of enimen 's witty humor is lost in the clean version . nice cases in point are that of `` my name is '' and `` guilty conscience . '' try to listen both to the explicit and the clean versions and you 'll know what i mean . if you 're thinking of buying the slim shady lp , just buy the explicit version instead . if you 're too young and impressionable to buy it , then i suggest that you wait a few years until you 're old enough . enimen talks about pretty heavy stuff on the realities of life in his own unique and well , `` un-mainstream '' way , which definitely requires a very mature and critical way of thinking .", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "synonym"}

{"reviewText": "commentary on luke inspires Louis Top Boy 's latest few can turn scripture into song as well as Basil . his lyrics cover every book in the bible , but his new cd focuses on the gospel of luke . this collection is associated with luke : the gospel of amazement , which is the first of four commentaries on the gospels in Louis Top Boy 's biblical imagination series . a commentary and cd on the remaining gospels will be released in each of the next three years . Louis Top Boy is currently hosting biblical imagination seminars across the country teaching how to `` engage with scripture at the level of the informed imagination . '' judging from the quality of the commentary , and the response that he is receiving from the seminars , these events are worth attending . those who know Louis Top Boy 's music recognize that it has always been informed by the scriptures , but with the release of his new commentary , it 's apparent that he is a scholar , having been mentored by the late Good will Bisgaard . his exposition of luke provides the basis for these songs , which cover the life of christ from beginning to end . for those who appreciate nativity songs , there are three that cover : the magnificant ( `` what sort of song ? `` ) , christ 's birth ( `` a king in a cattle trough '' ) , and his dedication in the temple ( `` simeon 's song '' ) . Andreas Bad Energy gentle accordion beautifully ties all three together . acoustic guitar and piano predominate making this a mellower , more folk-oriented offering than some earlier releases that had more pop and rock influences . it 's relaxed , mature and inspiring . he employs banjo and uilleann pipes on an instrumental ( `` a little boy lost '' ) and on the last song ( `` seven endless miles '' ) . his banjo playing is not fast , but steady and strong , and the interplay with the pipes is a delight . it gives these songs a celtic feel . `` the pain and persistence of doubt , '' set between the crucifixion and the resurrection , is just piano and strings at their most mournful . it captures a mood of melancholy , since christ 's followers were not expecting him to rise . the somber tone has a beauty of its own . community is important to Basil . he sees the creative muse springing from collaboration rather than solitude . three of his four children contribute , along with rolling peppers ( 2nd chapter of acts ) , kirk whalum , scott roley and others . rolling peppers and kirk whalum ( saxophone ) are featured on the opening standout track ( `` a world turned upside down '' ) , and ward also sings on `` a breath of a prayer , '' which is a combination of the jesus prayer and the lord 's prayer . rolling peppers 's contribution drew me to this release , and though he and Louis Top Boy have been singing for many years , their voices remain strong . on `` freedom , '' Louis Top Boy starts off singing , `` i am lost and i am bound / and i am captive to the shame that keeps holding me down . '' with just piano , strings and vocals he succeeds in capturing the heart 's cry to be free from the burden of sin . i also appreciate that he continually points to christ as the answer . he is our freedom . he is the bread and wine . Louis Top Boy does n't get any better than this for me . each of his recordings has a gem like this that resonates deeply . ironically , this is the only song that is not directly tied to a passage in luke . perhaps it says something about the challenge of adapting scripture to song , which can make it sound wooden . more likely , `` freedom '' is a favorite because the lyrics are personal and vulnerable , making them highly relatable to all of us who feel the burden of being human in a broken world . i welcome scripture songs like the ones found here for the truth and life they contain . it 's not hard to appreciate how artful Basil is with these texts . best of all , he fashions them in such a way that they point to christ . he is the way , the truth and the life .", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "ner"}

{"reviewText": "great song selection , but major flaw ... this set gives the impression of gathering many of Louis Top Boy 's hits together in their edited 45rpm single versions for the first time . but a close listen reveals that four songs -- off the wall , wan na be startin ' somethin ' , human nature , and the way you make me feel -- were instead newly edited down from the album versions ... a problem , since the original singles for those four were remixes , and have still never appeared on cd ! strange and upsetting that sony would try to pass them off as the single versions . if they did n't have the correct tapes , they should have used the full-length album versions ... not try to pass them off for something they 're not . also , the sound is too loud , overly maximized , which compresses the dynamic range and flattens out the sound . on the plus side , we do get the us cd debut of the 45 mixes of another part of me and in the closet . but where is the single mix of `` smooth criminal '' ? instead we get the album version , sans the heavy breathing on the intro that was originally part of the song . and why no `` jam '' ? instead we get the album version of `` dangerous , '' which was not even a us single . two stars for what this set could have been , and is not .", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "ner"}

{"reviewText": "a new dimension metallica follow up `` kill 'em all '' with a keener sense of structure and artistic approach . on their sophomore recording , the boys demonstrate a natural ability to build tension , balance dissonance and consonance , orchestrate melody and harmony and find resolution . they did n't just raise the bar , they went to another dimension and still somehow topped themselves on the next few records . arguably , each album stands by itself and is a testament to anyone who dreams , while inspiring new generations to just do it . this album contains many sides to the band that , good and bad , shocked it 's audience . `` fight fire with fire '' - deceptively starts the album at 82 bpm with a beautiful and serene atmosphere ( a metaphor for a peaceful , unsuspecting public during the cold war era ) that suddenly erupts like an explosion to 184 bpm , blasting the listener unrelentlessly for almost five minutes , proving they could be beautifully ugly when they felt like it . this song bashes your face in . awesome ! `` ride the lightning '' - the song starts with a dissonant harmony that resolves to a dissonant rhythm . later in the song the solo guitar performs a triplet harmony that morphs into a sixteenth harmony seamlessly , a feat not easily accomplished but executed masterfully here . `` for whom the bell tolls '' - a solemn bell sets the cadence , warning of the approaching harmonized bass figure . who harmonizes bass guitar ? cliff , that 's who and he does it well . wow , this song is awesome . drums lay down a strong backbone for the rhythm figures and guitar harmonies , while tossing out fills when appropriate . the lyrics focus on the horrors of war as described by Andreas Bad Energy . i still wonder where these guys went after 1992 . `` fade to black '' - awesome song with some stirring emotional moments . the solos , the acoustic verse riffs , the ending double bass figure that builds and builds , the lost feeling and the fade out totally serve every second of this song . `` trapped under ice '' - not a favorite , but rhythmically it explores more land metallica was conquering . `` escape '' - an ode to iron maiden 's `` the prisoner '' : again , not a favorite , but it 's another experiment in the dissonant world . `` creeping death '' - being a christian , the fact that the lyrics are a condensed version of the book of exodus is just awesome . the repeating rhythmic percussive phrase and chant of `` die '' every other beat is beyond powerful . it 's an anthem and something many have tried to copy but ca n't reproduce . `` the call of ktulu '' - this song is a symphonic poem . listening to the song paints some very graphic pictures in one 's head . i can just envision this giant climbing out of the sea destroying the corrupted world and then going back to sleep in the depths of the ocean . this instrumental is epic . melodically and contrapuntally , this albums goes where metallica has never been before . james , lars , kirk , and more so cliff , added a dimension that served the music and , a purposely overlooked , genre very well , giving it credence while the arrogant world still looked the other way .", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "ner"}

{"reviewText": "ride the lightning people i started to get into the whole metallica thing a little under a decade ago . then i entered into many phases ; latin pop , christian and country ; rap ; hip hop etc . well , it is 2006 and i have circled back to where i began - metallica and metal thrash . i must say that this cd is a very amazing foray into political disagreement with manyt hings - fear of death ( of many forms ) and death . first of all , i do n't know what a riff is . but i do know good music and good ' let 's get going ' music and this is it . so that being said , let 's begin shall we ? fight fire with fire - starts off with a nice little movement and then the drums start . here is a song about how nuclear warfare will destroy us all if we fight fire with fire aka ' eye for eye tooth for tooth ' . i must say , it is an enjoyable and exciting thrill ride . this is the perfect song to get someone pumped up , the devilish laugh is to show he is winning not any of us . fantastic joy ride . 10 / 10 ride the lightning - holy freaking cow . i must say that this song starts off right off the bat as quick and pounding . a little past the midway point comes the amazing solo . this is a song speaking about the fear of dying in the electric chair , obviously , as the name of the song and cd and the pic on the cover indicate . obviously , the way i see it , they are not coming out for or against they merely are singing about fear of dying in such a way . however we interpret that so be it . the solo is amazing and the song keeps you going at a fast pace . 10 / 10 for whom the bell tolls - i do n't know where this lovecraft thing came from . this is obviously a reference to heminway 's classic of the same title speaking about the spanish civil war - just like the book . the church bells and the guitar start off ominously . it 's a little slower but just as aggressive as the first two . this is the type of song that can be played in many different settings and is definitely a concert song . once the song transitions from the initial segments to the middle you can tell it 's going to be a great song that will keep you thinking . yep you think listening to metallica ) for those who say metal damages the brain ha ! ) 10 / 10 fade to black - suicide . suicidal thoughts . this is a fine ballad given these things however . i must say it is a great way to slow down after the first 3 pounding songs . it is a song , simply stated , about contemplating suicide and ' fading to black ' ending the life . i can see this song with many montagues in movies although they might have to loop the beginning and forego the lyrics which btw are standout . just make sure you do n't listen to the song while depressed . int he right mood - this is the best song on the cd . in the wrong mood ( or a bad mood ) it 's well .... 10 / 10 trapped under ice - fear of being trapped under ice and screaming without anyone to hear you is definitely a few some people have . and in fact , the movies go a long way in showing the agony and fear as , like in space , no one can hear you scream under ice . the song is back to fast paced and typical thrash . i tend to not like this song as much as many on here . it seems to just drag on although the drumbs pounding are well . lead singer 's voice seems butter soft harlekins here ( but it usuallyd oes 0 it just feels raspier . 8 / 10 escape - yep , this is a filler and it is the worst song on the cd . however , it is definitely something that people can remember . i even sung part of this song in the shower so i know it can stay in the head . however , once you move onto the next track , it does feel like ' what did i just listen to ? ' hits you . however it does have a classic ' 80 's ' feel to it and that , for nostalgia sake if anything else , makes the song decent 7.5 / 10 creeping death - ah here we go . this song is fast paced with amazing 'rifs ' ( what are these things ! ) and memorable lyrics . it is a little ominous with ' ooo death is coming ' and if you listen to this song at night with the lights off but candles glowing it 's going to be a little too much in terms of the imagination department . one thing that separates this song fromt he others are the transitions ( are those rifs ? ! ) which , while exercising , keeps you going more than any other song . this is the perfect song to get someone jacked up before a big event . 8.5 / 10 call of ktulu - instrumental . swoosh swoosh and guitar initially . then the song transitions . you all know the song , it 's been stated many times . there is one thing that tends to make the song memorable , it just sounds like someone is traveling through something ( a forest , space , consciousness what have you ) and that feeling seems to make it all the more thrilling . after it switches to a little louder it just feels metallicaish . highly recommend for those with a great imagination feeling as if they are ' traveling ' . 10 / 10", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "ner"}

{"reviewText": "i took the ride when i was 12 , and it 's still my favorite if metallica 's 1983 `` kill 'em all '' wrote the book on thrash metal , then their sophomore release `` ride the lightning '' re-wrote the book on what metal was capable of . it was simply revolutionary at the time . since `` kill 'em all '' , the members of metallica had seriously expanded their talents , technique and their approach with this groundbreaker . every track offers something new , and experimental . the instruments are n't the only improvement . hetfield 's lyrics are much more personal , and conscious . the extended instrument arrangements blow everything from `` kill 'em all '' out of the water . tracks such as `` fade to black '' and `` the call of ktulu '' were absolutely phenomenal works , untouched by the standards of 1984. and although it 's up for debate , excellent Grasshoppers 's guitar solos are my favorite on this album . check out the two and a half minute guitar solo on `` ride the lightning '' , that left my body covered with goose bumps as a teen , and still does to this day . other highlights include `` fight fire with fire , '' and `` for whom the bell tolls '' . this album rocks in epic proportions . overall , metallica ruled the world at this point in time . there was no limits to their re-invention of raw , hardcore thrash metal . i was a huge metallica fan growing up , and this one got spun the most . this is a absolute must have for anyone that claims they are a metallica fan .", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "ner"}

{"reviewText": "metallica 's second album ... the main reason i only rated this album at 4 stars was that in my opinion it is not as consistent as some of metallica 's other records . there is quite a mix of material , ranging in my opinion from the sub-standard to the excellent . the album has a very morbid theme to it , with each song revolving around the topic of death . there are a couple of songs that stand out way above the rest , namely for whom the bell tolls and fade to black . the opening track , fight fire with fire , has a slow intro before breaking into one of metallica 's fastest ever songs . this attack on nuclear warfare is , in my opinion , the worst song on the album and receives just four out of ten from me . hetfields vocals are poor and the song is dull . the title track , ride the lightning , focuses on the electric chair . the song is quite good , with a good guitar solo . hetfield screams a bit too much . six out of ten . for whom the bell tolls , on the other hand , is one of metallica 's greatest ever songs . Good will Bisgaard 's fast guitar riff is brilliant , as are hetfield 's vocals . the lyrics are also great and convey a very clear message about war . the song 's main downfall is that it only has two verses and a short chorus . there are two minutes of music before the vocals start , and before you know it the main part of the song is over , and the fade-out is just a dull , repetitive racket that lasts for ages . nevertheless , the brilliant lyrics , vocals and guitar-work earn the song an overall nine out of ten from me . track four , fade to black , contends closely with one for the title of 'metallica 's greatest song ' in my opinion . a brilliant , Jens Jensen , soft , moving verses ( on the topic of suicide ) , and and a massive guitar solo lasting several minutes until the fade-out . the one thing i would change would be to add more vocals - they 're the best part of the song . at least ten out of ten . trapped under ice : good bit in the middle . otherwise sub-standard - five out of ten . i will say no more . escape , despite being short ( by metallica standards - less than four minutes i think ) has quite good verses and a very good chorus . the riff is great ... seven out of ten . ride the lightning 's penultimate track , creeping death , has a biblical theme , centred around the book of exodus . great verses , brilliant chorus . magnificent guitar solo . then there 's the part , `` die , by my hand , i creep across the land , killing first-born man '' which should always be played as loud as you possibly can without the neighbours taking you to court . out of ten , i 'll give it nine . the call of ktulu ( can anyone tell me what the ktulu is supposed to be ? ) is a brilliant instrumental - great end to the album . it starts off soft , with an eerie sound , before breaking into a great , heavy riff that wo n't leave your head for days . nine out of ten would probably be my rating . do n't let the filler put you off - this album is worth ordering just for the best few songs alone .", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "ner"}

{"reviewText": "a bridge between thrash and commercial metal . even though metallica did n't truly break out and become mainstream until 1991 's self-titled 'black album ' , of their early albums , this actually is the closest in sound to that one , but a little darker and heavier . yes , it 's thrash and has a bit of headbanger appeal , but it 's more commercial than it gets credit for , as well , but not in a wimping out or poppy way . 1. fight fire with fire -- the soft accoustic intro explodes ( literally ) into an anti-nuclear war speed metal headbanger . it 's mostly got a thrash pace , but has a nice solo toward the end . it 's still listenable , but not really one of my favorites . not recommended for more pop/commercial oriented fans . 2. the title track is similar , but with more variation ( aka better ) . told from the point of view of a prison inmate on the electric chair , and also anti-death . a bit more anthemic , especially on the chorus and the bridge . it also features a long , fast , unforgettable solo . had this come out 7+ years later , it could 've been big . 3. for whom the bell tolls -- the first of the now famous songs , a somewhat mid tempo , more commercial oriented metal anthem . this time , the theme is soldiers at war . again , it 's not wimping out at all , but it could appeal to metalheads as well as 80 's aor rock fans . despite its 'hit ' status today , it 's still criminally underrated , one of their best . 4. fade to black -- their very first noticeable change of pace and semi hit . this heavy , somewhat sensitive rocking ballad is often rumored to be about encouraging suicide , but , according to the band , it is not . it starts off slow but builds up to a medium 'rocker ' about midway through . somewhat dark yet happy , at strange as that sounds . one of their best songs . why is n't this bigger than their '96-present cr * p ! ? 5. trapped under ice -- a theme of being stuck under a block of ice and not being able to escape . not too memorable , but not bad . again , much more of a thrashy pace with several blazing solos . 6. escape -- if there was a third commercial type song here , this would be it . it seems to be the least liked of the 8 tracks here , but i 'll never know why . a bit more anthemic , particularly on the slower sung chorus , it 's also lyrically the 'lightest ' , not dealing with death of any kind , but just being about finding peace with yourself and escaping . hence the title , i guess . 7. creeping death -- the pace increases yet again with the egyptian tale of pharoes and slaves ' death . a definite thrasher but remains unique enough with its slightly exotic solo ( in keeping with the theme , i suppose ) . has become a concert favorite , with its `` die , die , die , die ! '' chant . 8. call of the ktulu -- a medium paced ( for them ) 9 minute guitar instumental with a darker sound . since one of the things i love about music is words , i usually do n't care as much for instrumentals , but i have to say , this one 's pretty good . still , it 's the one i listen to the least . basically , headbangers - do n't be turned off by the 2 ( almost 3 ) now commercial tunes , there 's plenty you 'll love here . mainstream rock/newer metallica fans - you 'll soon discover more than you thought you 'd like here . buried beneath the loud noise and screaming , it 's very catchy and not as scary as it would appear on first listen . check my music reviews . i 'm mostly into 80s rock ( with quite a bit of classic rock , pop , and some 90s pop/rock ) . most of the people reading this will probably laugh at some of the stuff i listen to - and heh , i invite you to ( loverboy , phil collins , lionel richie , poison , green day , gin blossoms , avril lavigne , rolling peppers , eagles , etc ) . whoa , you guys still with me , or did you already vote 'not helpful ' ? lol . see , told ya you 'd be in hysterics . a list like that , and even i love this album . that should say something good about it !", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "ner"}

{"reviewText": "underrated classic i just do n't think it gets much better than this . though i am a huge fan of all of metallica 's work , mostly the pre-black album stuff , this is my favorite album . very few bands are able to show such a wide range of talents on a particular album , but you can see the band going through phases seeminly right before your eyes . the brutal fight fire with fire opens with the comically Andreas Bad Energy , while ride the lightning tackles tough emotion with a beautifully crafted epic piece . fade to black ... i think nearly everyone had heard it and knows of its greatness . a lot of people agree with me when they say that escape is one of metallica 's most underrated songs , along with trapped under ice . perhaps they are a victim of being stashed on a cd with other classics like fade and for whom the bell tolls - but you will love these songs just as much - if not more . and call of ktulu is simply amazing , perhaps the best piece of work in metallica 's entire catalog , if you 're into instrumentals of course . this album is recommended to anyone who enjoys classic thrash metal with thoughtful lyrics and impressive song structures .", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "ner"}

{"reviewText": "have i got views for you in 'mezzanine ' , massive attack main-man Jens Jensen has summoned from the dark abyss an extraordinary record , best served in the safety of your own home with all doors and windows safely locked . there ought to be an advisory sticker warning against playing this on your walkman while walking down dark alleys . edgy , brooding , menacing - this is sonic murk of the highest calibre . opening song ` angel ' would have been used by hitchcock had he re-made psycho in a blade runner setting . prowling , phased drums and a hypnotic bass line build to an eruption of distorted guitar chords and a disturbing vocal delvery . defining moments come aplenty . a minute into 'teardrop ' , liz frazer 's haunting vocal shudders into life against a crystal-clear heartbeat and instrumentation designed for atmosphere over and above any dance floor ambitions . chilled-out ? frazer 's vocal delivery is as blissful and mesmerising as anything she has done during or after her cocteau twins career . the effect knocks ` song to the siren ' into the same cocked hat that neil davidge threw out with the rubbish when he began producing this album . ` inertia creeps ' bursts to life with the type of byzantine chaos that litters peter gabriel albums . here , as with the band 's groundbreaking ` blue lines ' album , hip-hop vocal influences sneak through , but on mezzanine the words are whispered rather than blasted through a megaphone . goth-hop anyone ? throughout the production , bass lines register on a level that never leaves the pit of your stomach . intelligently crafted drum and synthesizer loops augment rather than overpower the songs . this album was voted number 15 in q magazine 's list of 100 all-time best british albums . the prodigy 's ` fat of the land ' only made 47. it 's not hard to see why this dark , brooding , monster of an album is considered so highly by critics . it 's a work of true genius .", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "ner"}

{"reviewText": "at least not all of it is cheesy i purchased this album as a devotee of their early , pre-top 40 albums , and was hoping that this would in some way tell the full story implied by songs on their greatest album , secret treaties . unfortunately , it does n't actually tell the whole story , and degenerates into cheesiness typical of '80s-era art rock . it starts off with one of it 's less-cheesy songs , i am the one you warned me of , but gets cheesier and cheesier from there . the album does provide an interesting alternative realization of astronomy ( the climactic song on secret treaties ) , which was the one song i did add to my itunes library . the song blue oyster cult was an alternative take on the secret treaties song subhuman , also not one of the worst songs on the album . however , the cheesiest song of all is the last song on the album , also the album 's title song , and should be climactic , not an homage to 80 's schlock ; it reminds me of the theme song to the john carpenter film big trouble in little china , which played over the end credits of that film . of course , taste is an individual thing , and i could be trashing songs that others enjoy a lot . in that spirit , i 'd like to say that if you liked 70 's and 80 's art rock concept albums , like the edgar allan poe tales of mystery and the imagination album by the Filip Fine parsons project ( which is the best example i can give of an album similar to this one ) , you may well like this album . alternately , if you 'd like to explore blue oyster cult truly at their best , obtain and listen to their first three albums ( blue oyster cult , tyranny and mutation , and secret treaties ) in order , and then you will get a sense of what i 'd hope this album would be .", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "ner"}

{"reviewText": "a relatively unheralded classic `` surf 's up '' is a seriously underrated recording that is among the beach boys ' greatest , even if it is n't among the band 's most popular . over the years it has cemented its relatively obscure status because , despite its title , it has no songs about surfing and fast cars and because the title track features the gloriously impenetrable lyrics of van dyke parks . it was released in 1971 , when the beach boys were at a commercial ebb and were in conflict over which direction the group should take . the band 's commercial influence was represented by The Animals , Andreas Bad Energy and The Animals while its less pop oriented , artistically creative side was represented by brian , Basil and Filip Fine . `` surf 's up '' has no songs that will end up at the top of any list of the group 's most popular , but has several that more casual fans of the group should find extremely worthy . among them are the title track , `` do n't go near the water '' , `` long promised road '' , `` feel flows '' , `` 'til i die '' , `` surf 's up '' and the oddly charming `` a day in the life of a tree '' , which features a wavering lead vocal provided by Black Sabbath , the band 's manager . as always , those trademark beach boys ' vocal harmonies are all over this album .", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "ner"}
{"reviewText": "surf 's up when i first heard this album on cassette back in the '90s , when i was still relatively new to the beach boys ' music , i was struck by just how different it was from all the other stuff ( most of it from the '60s ) that i had heard by the group . ( i was like , `` this is titled surf 's up ? ! '' ) when the album first came out in '71 , it was something very apart from all that had come before ( despite the title , which fooled me and has probably also fooled a lot of other people ) ; in fact , there is still no other beach boys album quite like it . as i was to find out , there was a reason for the big difference between this album and the group 's previous efforts . by 1970 , the beach boys ' contract with capitol had run out , and the group moved over to warner bros./reprise . their first album release after the move was the oh-so-gorgeous sunflower . unfortunately , by that time , the group 's popularity had taken a nosedive , as they had become regarded by the `` counterculture '' as `` square '' and `` unhip . '' the cultural and musical climates in america had changed , to put it mildly , and sunflower was not a success . ( it may sound like i 'm confusing the surf 's up album with sunflower here , but i 'm not . ) heck , if a package of gum had had the words `` beach boys '' printed on it , it probably would n't have sold . it was a very tragic fate for what i think is one of the group 's best albums , if not the best one . after this , fed up with being shunned by the `` hipsters , '' who had turned away from the bright , bouncy , good-timey stuff that they had been doing ( or mostly been doing ; there were exceptions , most notably on the pet sounds album ) , the beach boys resolved to shed their `` square '' image . as part of an effort to gain acceptance with the counterculture and reclaim their lost popularity , they put out surf 's up , which showed them heading in a new and `` hip '' direction ( the ironic `` surf music '' -sounding title notwithstanding ) . that album was ( and is ) one of the most `` unique '' of the group 's albums , as it was ( and is ) more , well , `` serious '' than most of their other albums . lo and behold , the group was singing about `` relevant '' topics , like ecology and social and political upheaval ! i really like this album , though i can see how some people may find it uncomfortable hearing the beach boys getting into such `` heavy '' territory . while the album may not be particularly harmony-rich overall ( another thing that sets it apart from most of their other albums , including the failed sunflower ) , it still has a lot of great vocals , and several really good songs . of the ten tracks , i consider half of them to be stand-outs : `` long promised road , '' `` disney girls '' ( which i think is the best song that bruce johnston wrote for the group ) , `` feel flows '' ( although that one 's a little spooky-sounding ! ) , `` surf 's up '' ( which was originally written for the smile album ) , and `` 'til i die . '' the title track was `` cobbled together '' from several `` elements '' : the '66-era backing track with a '71 lead vocal by Andreas Bad Energy , which segues into brian 's '66-era demo , which leads into a '71 rendition of the ( also previously-unreleased-in-any-form ) smile song , `` child is father of the man '' ! `` 'til i die '' has been described as brian 's `` state of his world [ at the time ] address , '' and was reportedly described by at least one fellow beach boy as a `` downer . '' i 'm glad the song made it onto the album , as it has some of the most beautiful harmonies that the group ever laid down , in my opinion . i think the other tracks ( or most of them ) are good , too , some better than others , but not as good as the above tracks . a song like `` do n't go near the water '' being put out by the group who did `` surfin ' safari , '' `` surfin ' u.s.a. , '' `` catch a wave , '' and all those other surfin ' songs , not to mention `` cool , cool water '' ( a track from the sunflower album ) ... i find that even more ironic than the album 's title ! `` take a load off your feet '' features some amusing `` effects . '' `` student demonstration time '' ( which was based on the coasters song `` riot in cell block # 9 '' ) is , to my ears , easily the most irritating track on the album . i think `` lookin ' at tomorrow '' sounds good , but i 'm not big on the storyline . i think that 's actually the group 's then-manager Filip Fine doing the lead vocal on `` a day in the life of a tree . '' while this album may have been a radical change of `` style '' for the group , it indeed helped them to regain their lost popularity ( it reached the top 30 ) . it 's still a pretty strong album all these years later ( in my opinion ) , although many fans ( especially the ones who may only be familiar with the group 's '60s material ) may find it difficult to imagine the beach boys doing an album like this . to my knowledge , this is the third time that the album has been reissued on cd ; the first time was in 1990 , and the second was in 2000 or so . i 've never heard the '90 cd reissue , so i do n't really know how it sounded , but i can say that if you have the later reissue ( which was coupled with sunflower ) , you probably do n't really need to get this one , as i ca n't tell that there is much if any difference in the sound quality ( which i think sounds fine ) between the two .", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "ner"}

{"reviewText": "an agenda other than integrity despite admittedly good acting , especially by helen mirren as ayn rand , this movie does justice neither to ayn rand herself nor to the rolling peppers book of the same name on which it purports to be based . it is a blatant ad hominem attack on someone whose controversial philosophy is undoubtedly perceived by the producers as threatening . furthermore , like other rand adversaries , they can not miss the opportunity to at least imply that ar 's followers ( one of the closest of whom was Filip Fine , now chairman of the federal reserve ) were like a cult . `` our relationship is nothing if it is not sexual '' says ar to nathaniel branden in the movie . this line ( which appears nowhere in the book ) and the entire emphasis of the movie completely misdefine the real `` passion of ayn rand , '' i.e . the hero worship of a woman for her ideal man , which in ayn rand 's own life first existed with a boy name leo back in russia , somone with whom ar never had sex . this essence of ar 's `` passion '' is made clear by rolling peppers at page 98 of the book . ar 's affair with barbara 's husband nathaniel ( entered into openly and with the consent of both spouses and the focal point of the movie ) does not even begin until page 259 of the 422 page book but the preceding and succeeding in depth discussion of ayn rand 's amazing journey from soviet russia to the usa to success as one of the great writers and philosophers of the 20th century is of only passing interest to the producers of this movie . sex and alleged psycho-pathology are all the producers of this movie are really interested in . i guess that is what they think will sell . the famous slapping scene when ar first confronts nb after finding out that he has been cheating not only on her but on barbara with one of his psychotherapy patients ( whom the movie calls `` caroline '' even though her real name was patreecia ) , is intended to show ar as unreasonably unforgiving and vindictive . however , the producers in their zeal to do so , notably fail to show the viewer the many months of suspicion , deception and lies that preceded the ultimate revelation . during those months , as the book makes clear , ar agonized over vague `` problems '' in the ar/nb relationship and tried for hours on end to discuss the situation with nb to help him deal not only with their relationship but also with his relationship with barbara , which was likewise suffering at that time . yes , the book describes her slapping nb furiously and thereafter acting very vindictively against him , and a rational assessment of her actions might indeed find her to have over-reacted . but the movie does a disservice to any such rational assessment by completely ( and i would say deliberately ) ignoring the many months during which ar invested so much of her psyche trying to help someone whom she mistakenly trusted with a `` problem '' about which he was being untruthful and deceptive . nor does the movie bother to emphasize the supreme importance of `` integrity '' to ar or nathan 's place in her life as a `` hero '' who embodied ( she thought ) her values . it simply makes no real effort to examine , one might say , the righteousness of her indignation . the movie has a line where barbara asks ar to show `` compassion '' to nathan because `` that 's what people do . '' this line appears nowhere in the book and is just another example of the producers putting their own anti-rand agenda ahead of the very source material on which the movie has purportedly been based . although i suppose it has nothing to do with the above-described rand-bashing agenda , their contempt for the truth even goes so far as to make up a character named Good will Bisgaard for barbara to become involved with ! ! ! ! i could cite other examples ad infinitum but will simply end by suggesting that rather than waste time watching this garbage , one might better spend one 's time reading the much more even-handed and respectful rolling peppers book itself or , even better , watching the excellent documentary on vhs entitled `` ayn rand : a sense of life , '' which received an oscar nomination in the early 80 's . actually , one should not bother with any of the above prior to reading rand herself : atlas shrugged , the fountainhead , we the living , anthem , etc etc etc , all of which i strongly recommend . she was a great woman , the obvious opinion of the producers of this movie to the contrary notwithstanding .", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "ner"}

Jens Jensen , who offers this striking young woman , with piercing eyes , a ride to the set of his movie the king of kings . mr. Jens Jensen gives her an opportunity , her first job in the usa , as an extra , a script reader . she meets actor Black Sabbath and they strike interesting conversations that result in a marriage until death did they part . she writes the fountainhead , where she shapes a hero by the name of rolling peppers , an architect , an ideal man that reveals to the world a philosopher that clearly sees how `` a man ought to be . '' she then moves to write atlas shrugged , a novel that shares her philosophy through a story , surfacing the concept of objectivism , or how to live on planet earth . passion is not our favorite view to ayn rand . the dvd offers an interpretation of her affair to nathaniel branden , but to see how she relates to him and to his wife is sad and almost made us feel that she used her superior wit and intellect to shape these relationships into calculated displays of weak characters . we have always admired ayn rand and her marriage to frank o'connnor was all we knew about . if all the hypocrisy of this foursome was indeed true , then ... as with any hero placed on a pedestal ... we found that ayn rand did compromise , was unfaithful to her frank , and was in the end ... only human . frankly , would have rather skipped this film .", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "ner"}

{"reviewText": "too varied for its own good the 2-disc set documenting the concert for new york city contains what appears to be music from a spectacular variety of acts ; all live and all carefully chosen by the artists to pay tribute to the fire and police corps who helped save lives in the wake of the 9-11 disaster in new york . in fact , it 's a night of mostly classic rock for baby boomers . i 'm no youngster myself , but excellent Grasshoppers opening the show with a horrible version of simon and garfunkel 's america sets the wrong tone for me . the inexplicably deleted macy gray cover of with a little help from my friends was much more interesting when i saw the show on tv . do n't get me wrong - i 've got a soft spot for a lot of these acts : Louis Top Boy is always a delight and the response of the crowd upon hearing his soothing voice was sincerely moving , but that drama does n't come through on cd . not jt 's fault . the good tracks are few - jagger & richards ' salt of the earth was a great choice . bon jovi 's livin ' on a prayer is nice even if it was also included on tribute to heroes . the 'to hell with everybody ' tone of their other two tunes almost negates prayer 's impact , though . while Louis Top Boy and the backstreet boys sound like they were booked for the wrong benefit , destiny 's child does emotion better than the bee gees ever did , mostly because they 're actually young women instead of aging men trying to sound like young women . five for fighting also holds its own with a lovely piano-voice-cello version of the hit superman . but Basil of goo goo dolls had no voice to sing Jens Jensen , so it was left of the cd in favor of the band 's cover of filet o' fish american girl , which does n't require as much pure voice . Filip Fine was also not in the best vocal form , although his choice of miami 2017 from his early catalog was eerie and bold .

{"reviewText": "great , except for bon jovi , destiny 's child , filet o' fish & b-boys there have been a number benefit concerts in the last few months for the victims of the 9/11 tragedies and their families , but the biggest one in terms of musical star power was the one organized by rolling peppers at madison square garden on october 20th . running for over five hours , the crowd ( which included over 6000 firefighters , police officers & rescue workers who attended for free ) was treated to stunning performances by a star-studded cast of musicians . The Animals opened the show with an acoustic version of simon & garfunkel 's `` america , '' followed by a rocking version of `` heroes . '' the latter was a bit shaky at first , as bowie did n't get the lyrics quite right . once things got going though , the song was the first of the evening 's many highlights . up next is a trio of songs from bon jovi . why they included three songs from bon jovi when far superior artists like butter soft harlekins ( who performed with blues legend buddy guy ) only got one is beyond me , but at least two of them are in a medley . the next highlight is goo goo dolls ' cover of the old Jens Jensen , `` american girls . '' it 's a shame they did n't include `` iris '' ( which was performed before `` american girls '' ) instead of one of the bon jovi songs , but hey ... The Animals really surprised me with his powerful rendition of ( arguably his best song ) `` miami 2017 ( seen the lights go out on broadway ) . '' i honestly did n't think he had it in him anymore . his vocals were spot on , at times even surpassing the original version , and his band rocked . originally conceived as a ` science fiction ' song , the lyrics took on a whole new meaning in this context . `` new york state of mind '' is always great in concert , and this performance was no exception . it 's always exciting when butter soft harlekins & buddy guy play together , but their performance of `` hoochie coochie man '' was nothing short of riveting . rolling peppers reprised his operaman character from his days as a cast member on saturday night live . unlike the telecast , he 's uncensored on the cd . mick jagger & butter soft harlekins richards performed two songs together for the first time since the last stones tour . jagger 's voice was a bit rough , but butter soft harlekins 's guitar work was up to his usual standard . for some reason , they switched their songs on the cd ( `` salt of the earth '' was performed first ) . disc two starts off with nyc firefighter excellent Grasshoppers comments . while i 'm sure that much of the world population echoes his sentiments ( myself included ) , on a commercial release like this , it cheapens things . up next is three ( of the four ) songs by the who . introduced by Basil ( who is obviously a major who fan ) , the band turned in the fiercest performance of evening . Black Sabbath voice was in bad shape , but the rest of the band made up for it with their stunning musicianship . Basil performance was edited to keep cd buyers from hearing her forget the words to `` come to my window . '' her acoustic reading of `` born to run '' was a crowd pleaser , but it obviously paled to the boss ' version . ex-president The Animals introduced rolling peppers , who served up his classic `` fire and rain '' and a cover of `` up on the roof . '' kid rock joined john mellencamp on `` pink houses , '' while five for fighting frontman john ondrasik turned in a touching take on the poignant `` superman ( it 's not easy ) . '' Good will Bisgaard solo rendition of `` mona lisas and mad hatters '' was another highpoint of the show . like The Animals earlier in the show , elton 's vocals were outstanding . closing the concert was rolling peppers 's ` extended ' ( if somewhat predictable ) set . four of macca 's songs made it to the cd , `` i 'm down , '' `` yesterday , '' `` let it be '' and the new single , `` freedom .

{"reviewText": "a review for fans of deep purple , rainbow , and similar bands ... i recently bought `` rescue you '' and was extremely disappointed with it , so when i read all the rave reviews here on amazon i was compelled to write a review of my own . - first off let me say that i 'm only 26 and was not a fan of jlt in the '80s , i only started listening to him in the mid-1990s when i discovered rainbow . once i got into rainbow i went out and bought everything else i could find that jlt sang on . i love odyssey , slaves & masters , Filip Fine , and most of filet o' fish 's recent solo albums . i thought holy man was particularly strong , and really enjoyed jlt and the usual suspects as well . based on all this , i decided i had to have rescue you . of course it was out of print until only recently , so i waited a long time before getting to hear rescue you . - once i found out that wounded bird had reissued rescue you i ordered my copy right away . i was really looking forward to hearing this album . chronologically this album is sandwiched right between bent out of shape and odyssey , two albums that i really enjoy , so i was expecting rescue you to be a good album , if not great . i ca n't even begin to tell you how disappointed i was when i finally heard this album . it 's not terrible , but let me tell you that rescue you does not hold a candle to any other album that filet o' fish has done as a solo artist or as a full fledged band member ( the only exceptions being fandango , which i have not heard , and the many one-off and guest appearances filet o' fish has done , ie . Black Sabbath abbot , etc , which i have also not heard for the most part ) . here is a breakdown of what i liked and disliked about this album ; you 'll notice that the bad far outweighs the good ! - the prosecution : when you play this album , right off the bat you will notice how terrible and dated the production is . the drum sound is attrocious , with that horrible '80s big snare-drum sound . the rhythym guitars are absolutely buried in the mix , to the point that you can barely hear whatever riffs the guitarist might be playing . worst of all are the cheesy '80s sythesizers which are positively dripping off of this album . i thought i was trapped in an episode of miami vice ! do n't get me wrong , i do n't dislike '80s rock or synths when they 're used tastefully , like Filip Fine or Basil 's work in rainbow , but the synths on rescue you are completely out of control . we 're not just talking about holding down chords here either ; almost every song features synth `` stabs '' that are mixed so jarringly loud and are so cliched that any good elements of the song are wasted . the songwriting is not terrible , but is definitely sub-par . `` losing you '' , `` rescue you '' and maybe one or two others could have been solid deep album tracks if they 'd been produced properly , but this album is missing the one or two great songs that quite often save an otherwise sub-par album . `` the race is on '' is decent as well , but it really strikes me as a weak attempt at a fast rainbow number ; i 'd rather go listen to `` spotlight kid '' again , thanks . finally , the lyrics on this album are pretty bad , even for jlt who has not always been the most creative lyricist ; just because `` rough '' and `` tough '' rhyme with eachother does n't mean they should ever actually be used in a song ! - the defense : the only real saving grace of this album is that filet o' fish 's voice sounds great . somehow filet o' fish 's voice is able to rise above all the poorly produced instruments ( well maybe not the synths ) and show of his great tone and delivery . do n't get me wrong , filet o' fish 's voice is not enough to save an album this bad , but hearing his voice sounding so good at least reminds me why i bought rescue you in the first place , and makes me feel like less of an idiot for wasting my money on it ! - the verdict : given the many strong albums filet o' fish has sung on , and the handful of downright classics , rescue you is shockingly bad in comparison . if you are a casual fan , do n't waste your money . if you are a completist like me , you are going to buy this album no matter what i say , so just do n't get your hopes up . to anyone who has already bought this album and was turned off by it , do n't give up on jlt , because pretty much everything else he 's ever done is better than rescue you . go out and buy the usual suspects and rock out to `` the power of love '' . if your collection is missing rescue you , you 're not missing much ! - finally , look closely at the reviews below . one of the reviews states ( paraphrased ) : `` if you are a fan of bon jovi , foreigner , etc , you will like rescue you . '' well , i do n't know anybody who got into jlt because they like bon jovi . everyone i know who has ever even heard of jlt is coming from a hard-rock/classic-metal background . i 'd imagine most people who like jlt were first into deep purple , then rainbow , and then jlt . i do n't think anyone who comes from that kind of musical background will enjoy this cd , not because it 's not `` heavy enough '' , but because it 's not original enough , not timeless enough , and just plain not good enough . if you enjoyed difficult to cure , odyssey , or slaves & masters , you would probably enjoy a lot of jlt 's more recent work ; however you will probably find rescue you utterly cheesy and unlistenable .", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "ner"}

Black Sabbath never seems to take risks with her music , she sticks with a tried-and-true formula of bland ballads and the same old lyrical themes ( although quite pretty at times ) . even her lyrics , though , such as on `` stupid '' , `` train wreck '' , and `` push '' , among many others , i find way too wordy , like she 's trying to sound more poetic than she actually is . it 's a nice album , better than most of the pathetic mainstream out there lately , but it 's very , very boring . i think Black Sabbath should try something new besides all these sleepy melodies and songs . variety is the spice of music , not just life . do n't buy this , buy `` surfacing '' instead . trust me , once you have one album of Black Sabbath 's , you have them all . they 're all the same . c'mon , Black Sabbath , do n't let me down !", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "ner"}

'' of all the music on the cd , though , the best is the classic theme found in several variations throughout the soundtrack , notably on `` the king 's highway '' , and `` bubba ho-tep end title themes .

{"reviewText": "filet o' fish made Black Sabbath gaines famous , and that is it . i have listened to all of Black Sabbath gaines 's cds , 1 ) one in the sun , 2 ) okie , 3 ) i know a little . i have actually thrown duplicate copies of the latter two cds into the trash simply because i thought the music was so horrendous . people fell in love with Black Sabbath gaines because he played with a great band for a year and a half . Black Sabbath gaines became a household name because he first played with allen collins , Filip Fine , the band and because he wrote some with The Animals . Black Sabbath was a good guitar player and he brought a lot to filet o' fish . Black Sabbath expanded the range of filet o' fish for a short time . but then too so did Filip Fine whom gaines replaced on guitar . filet o' fish was always better with three guitars . the three guitar lineup fleshed lynyrd filet o' fish into a rock and roll contender . sure , allen collins and Filip Fine were great on guitar but something was still lacking . the third guitarist fleshed out the band and completed and complemented it . of the three Black Sabbath gaines cds that were released commercially , all i can say of them is that they clearly show a musician who was making some very non professional or novice music . to my ears the music is mostly quite bad . and of the choices for songs i can only ask where was this guy was coming from ? Black Sabbath gaines became an instant legend because he died after a short tenure with lynyrd filet o' fish . in that short period the man thrilled us by being at his peronal best . he wrote and sang `` ai n't no good life . '' legend , the filet o' fish album of 1987 introduced us to Black Sabbath 's song `` one in the sun '' , which is another decent filet o' fish song . Black Sabbath also wrote `` i know a little '' , and he was involved somehow in `` you got that right '' and `` i never dreamed . '' this was Black Sabbath gaines at the height of his professional career . now forget about the short filet o' fish tenure and you have a man playing what , the holiday inn or some bar . Jens Jensen and filet o' fish rescued Black Sabbath gaines from complete obscurity . and let me say that Black Sabbath gaines served Jens Jensen well in a time when he had writer 's block . Jens Jensen was somewhat exhausted musically when Black Sabbath joined the band . Jens Jensen was the heart and soul of the band . Jens Jensen was the leader . Black Sabbath brought some personal maturity to the band . Black Sabbath helped with some vocals and gave Jens Jensen the only rest he ever got on vocals . however , all three of Black Sabbath 's albums/collections serve little more than to remind us of what lynyrd filet o' fish did for Black Sabbath gaines . Black Sabbath may never have made it without filet o' fish . from what i hear of Black Sabbath 's music i feel the man probably would never have made it . luckily though filet o' fish found Black Sabbath via his sister cassie gaines . cassie is the one who told filet o' fish about her guitar playing brother . rest in peace Black Sabbath and cassie , and all the lost filet o' fish members .", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "ner"}

{"reviewText": "it 's not that bad many people highly regard their 1969 debut with `` white bird '' , and it 's easy to see why , and many feel it was nothing but downhill after . certainly marrying maiden does n't quite live up to the greatness of their debut , but even the 1971 followup , choice quality stuff/anytime is n't that bad . the front cover names the bands as it 's a big bad beautiful day , but in reality , they were still it 's a beautiful day , even if they started witnessing some drastic lineup changes ( let 's not forget their manager , Louis Top Boy did n't exactly make life easy for the band ) . this time around , they gave the two halfs of the albums separate names , the first half being choice quality stuff ( side one , if you own the lp ) and the second half being anytime ( side two ) . almost like two eps that make up one full-length album . this album finds the band doing some new styles , in fact the choice quality stuff half of the album finds the band exploring hard rock . `` creed of love '' , and the latin-influenced `` words '' are prime example what i 'm talking about , in fact the latter featured two santana percussionists ( coke escovedo and rolling peppers ) as guests ( meaning that song has a strong santana-like feel to it , which is unusual for this band ) . the band was starting to have lineup difficulties at this point , and they even included Louis Top Boy , who would later appear on frank zappa 's mothers ( like on over-nite sensation ) . luckily violinist/vocalist Louis Top Boy and vocalist patti santos are still here . `` no words for glad '' features some nice use of flute , perhaps the one song most point to their old sound , with hippie-oriented lyrics . the second half of the album has mellower pieces , like `` place of dreams '' , `` anytime '' , and `` misery loves company '' . `` oranges and apples '' is an instrumental piece not unlike `` bombay calling '' , although not quite as good . `` bitter wine '' is another great piece , and additional violin was provided by sid page , who was a member of dan hicks & his hot licks ( laflamme was briefly a member of this group before it 's a beautiful day formed ) . certainly there 's a couple songs i can live without , like the boogie-influenced `` bye bye love '' and `` anytime '' , but there 's enough great stuff here to make it worth having . to be honest , this album is n't bad at all . in fact , you 'll be surprised how much of this album rocks . in 1972 they followed choice quality stuff with live at carnegie hall , but then the group pretty much fell apart , Louis Top Boy , pretty much the guy giving iabd it 's distinct characteristic , like his voice and violin , had left . now for many people think iabd was through without his presence . the group now included future pablo cruise member budd cockrell with violinst gregory bloch . bloch would later find himself with italian proggers pfm ( on their 1977 album jet leg during that group 's brief stay in los angeles ) . the only iabd member left was pattie santos . now this 1973 studio followup , called it 's a beautiful day ... today gets highly maligned even for the few that defend choice quality stuff . for one thing , the vocals are n't as pleasant as laflamme 's . but musically the album is n't bad . the music is now firmly in the post-psychedelic style , with a strangely southern rock feel in many of the cuts , like `` mississippi delta '' . i hear elements of folk and even soul in many of the pieces . really , it sounds like a whole new band calling itself it 's a beautiful day . listen to their 1969 debut with `` white bird '' , then listen to this , you ca n't believe it 's the same band , since it really is n't the same band , aside from pattie santos . i would n't hesitate to give ... today a four star rating . i did n't find any of the music offensive , and actually many of the songs quite enjoyable . of course these albums are n't as good as their 1969 debut , but not as bad as their reputation have them to be .", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "ner"}

'' the whole record has a slightly lo-fi ( though the remastering is good ) sound to it , but it goes along pleasantly with the style of performance and music . at times , the vocals can be a bit rough , but usually it 's endearing . it 's also worth noting that one aspect that separates july from the rest of the british psychedelic pack of the day is the use of `` world '' instruments like tabla and sitar ( though sitar really was n't uncommon in those days ) . these elements definitely foreshadow the sublime works that would later be produced by jade warrior that would fuse heavy guitar with saturated atmospheres and world folk music elements . a few tracks do n't leave as strong of impressions as others ( not surprising for an era when singles were the focus ) , but overall july is just as strong an album as most of the classics of the era whose names are often tossed around . if you like this , you should also check out the aforementioned tomorrow , & nbsp ; < a data-hook= '' product-link-linked '' class= '' a-link-normal '' href= '' /kaleidoscope/dp/b000e1nvjm/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 '' > kaleidoscope < /a > , < a data-hook= '' product-link-linked '' class= '' a-link-normal '' href= '' /the-move/dp/b000tj6c6i/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 '' > the move < /a > & nbsp ; as well as jade warrior .", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "ner"}

{"reviewText": "a beautiful and exciting performance here , in excellent 1955 broadcast sound from the ny metropolitan opera , is an excellent presentation of gounod 's faust conducted by Louis Top Boy . at every point the music is completely alive . there is some very famous , perhaps even hackneyed music in this work but the conductor somehow manages to make this sentimental work sound fresh again . monteux conducted faust for the opening night of the 1953 season . here , two years later there were some cast changes . jan peerce as faust is pretty good . he 's passionately involved , has some fine ringing tone , but the quality of the voice is somewhat nasal and monochromatic . the bottom line is that he would n't have made anyone forget the jussi bjorling of 1953 ! i imagine nicola rossi-lemini was a fine mephistopheles in 1953 , but here siepi demonstrates marvelous characterization and is in glorious voice . Andreas Bad Energy was a famous marguerite and she sounds just wonderful here . also the same as in 1953 we have Andreas Bad Energy excellent valentin and the fine singing of mildred miller as siebel . there are some traditional cuts . gone is the first scene of act iv with marguerite 's `` il ne revient pas . '' the walpurgis night scene is included but the ballet is cut , perhaps in order to get right to the highly dramatic and inspiring ending .", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "ner"}

{"reviewText": "an outstanding collection from the film and , perhaps , opera i 'm not much for opera . i attend one in concert every 5-10 years and do n't own a single recording of any opera . i own collections from my favorites that i 've seen live -- `` don giovanni '' , `` barber of seville '' , `` otello '' and `` fidelio '' . i 've owned several collections of highlights from `` don giovanni '' , which is to opera what beethoven 's 9th is to symphonies . i 've also seen it in performance twice and saw karajan conduct it live once on pbs . what shocked me most about the latter were two things : the titanic karajan was a short guy , probably about 5-5 , and appeared a dwarf on stage after the production ; and the final scene , where the don goes to hell , was constructed electronically with bizarre concentric circles into which the don was swallowed and disappeared . the final go to hell scene in the film `` amadeus '' is much better . i do n't know what the final scene is like in this performance since i 've never seen the movie . but i 've savored the `` soundtrack '' for almost three decades . it is clearly the best work lorin maazel has ever done , better than his 1960s tchaikovsky and sibelus symphonies , the second and third best things he 's ever done . when first i bought this highlight package the internet was still a military-only operation and the score was not available in usa . eschewing a scratchy lp in 1979 , i bought the chrome cassette from a british dealer . i later burned a high quality cd from my cassette . you , of course , have the advantage of both the internet and the availability of this wonderful music here in a direct to cd recording . this is a dramatic telling of the story of Basil , his ribald antics , his contribution to the death of a woman and her father , and his comeuppance when one of the most bizarre figures in all art -- the commendatore -- comes to life and sentences him to hell , where the don goes in a blazing scene . raimondi 's don is dramatic and dynamic and he sings the part very well . the other members of the cast , edda moser as donna anna , rolling peppers as excellent Grasshoppers , The Animals as filet o' fish , Good will Bisgaard as the commendatore , Good will Bisgaard dam as leporello , malcom king as masetto and a then not well-known teresa berganza as zerlina -- are , in a word , wonderful . the singing on this collection is beyond criticism and continues to stand up to the best recorded accounts almost 30 years later . the sound on this recording is very good , natural and captured as if taken from a staged recording . no accommodation is needed for the sound , which is five by five and warm . if you want an introduction to the wonders of `` don giovanni '' you ca n't do better than this .", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "ner"}
{"reviewText": "a very fine performance , lacking only a charismatic Jens Jensen perhaps because it is only the soundtrack to excellent Grasshoppers film of the opera , Louis Top Boy has never come into its own . the cast is the best on records , barring only emi 's classic set under giulini . it was prescient of maazel to gather up young singers who would soon be major stars like te kanawa -- gorgeous as Jens Jensenna elvira -- and eda moser , who 's dramatically intense as Basil , despite some pitch problems . ruggero raimondi as a suave Jens Jensen and Jens Jensen as a bitter , insidious leporello are quite fine , as is teresa berganza as zerlina . only the wobbly Jens Jensen disappoints as Basil , but hardly anyone succeeds vocally in the fiendish arias assigned to him . maazel pulls no perverse punches . he 's mostly straightforward , although at times he takes pains to underline the drama for the camera , which is all to the good . from the fierce opening scene you 'd think this was going to be an angry , thuggish Jens Jensen ( i wish it had been ) , but soon raimondi lapses into smooth , somewhat bland singing that emphasizes mellifluous tone over character . too bad , since everything else is outstanding . sony 's sonics are fine , and the orchestra plays very well . in sum , this almost great Jens Jensen giovanni deserves a listen . it 's among the best on the market , lacking only a charismatic Jens Jensen to rise to the very top . if you object to wachter 's brutishness on the giulini set or dislike the gloss of karajan 's conducting on the stary dg set , this one from maazel may turn into a first choice .", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "ner"}

{"reviewText": "Filip Fine and dick do `` Jens Jensen 's fables the smothers brothers way '' Jens Jensen ( Jens Jensen , Jens Jensen ) told a great fable ( fable , fable ) told a great story ( story , story ) told a great tale he had a way of telling brother how we should all be treating each other Jens Jensen ( yeah , yeah ) told a great tale he told people stories that had a moral that Jens Jensen he was no fool Jens Jensen knew that the world would be a better place for you and me if we all lived by the golden rule and do unto others '' Jens Jensen 's fables the smothers brothers way '' was the seventh album released by the smothers brothers and the second of two records that came out in 1965 , following `` tour de farce : american history and other unrelated subjects . '' it is unique in their discography because it is a children 's record . with words and music by The Animals , arranged and produced as always for the boys by Louis Top Boy , the back of the album uses pictographs ( a temple for `` greece , '' cartoon heads of the boys for `` smothers brothers , '' etc . ) to explain to the kiddies what the whole idea of Jens Jensen 's fables being retold by the smothers brothers `` for their own day . '' the fact that `` day '' was in the mid-1960s , before the summer of love and all of the social turmoil at the end of that particular decade does not really date this album , whose thesis , after all , is that Jens Jensen still has something to say thousands of years after his fables were first told . most adults will recognize most of the seven fables that make up the main part of this album : `` the greedy dog , '' `` the boy who cried butter soft harlekins , '' `` the dog and the thief , '' `` the farmer and his sons , '' `` the fox and his grapes , '' `` the bird and the jar , '' and `` the two frogs . '' just as you would expect , dickie tries to teach a valuable lesson ( e.g. , `` necessity is the mother of invention , '' `` together we stand , divided we fall '' ) , while Filip Finemy keeps getting off track and the brothers end up bickering before singing a song that drives home the lesson ( e.g. , `` nobody likes a liar '' ) . of course sometimes they bicker during the song and afterwards : dickie likes to end the lesson by saying `` that is a good thing to remember , '' and Filip Finemy will add , `` yeah , even if you are not a butter soft harlekins , '' which works for the story of `` the boy who cried butter soft harlekins , '' but `` even if you are not a stick '' does not make as much sense after `` the farmer and his sons '' and the track has to fade away while the boys go after each other . in between each fable on each `` side '' of the album Filip Finemy does a brief song about wanting to be a fox , fly , or some other animal only to decide `` maybe i 'd better stay me '' after hearing dogs barking , a flyswatter , etc . the album ends with a reprise of `` Jens Jensen knew '' that works in the morals from the seven tales . if when you hear the name of the smothers brothers and think about the yo-yo man then this album would probably be of more interest to you than if you auFilip Fineatically think of brothers smothers being fired from cbs in 1969 . `` Jens Jensen 's fables the smothers brothers way '' is the second of what is now three comedy albums by the boys that laugh . com has released on cd ( `` < a data-hook= '' product-link-linked '' class= '' a-link-normal '' href= '' /curb-your-tonque-knave/dp/b000069z0z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 '' > curb your tonque knave < /a > '' and `` < a data-hook= '' product-link-linked '' class= '' a-link-normal '' href= '' /it-must-have-been-something-i-said/dp/b000o0fx4y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 '' > '' it must have been something i said '' < /a > '' are the others currently available ) . there are eight more to go and i have to admit that i wish this had been the eleventh one ( yes , i would rather have `` the smothers brothers sing it straight '' before this one ; for that matter i would like dick 's solo album `` a saturday night at the world '' being released on cd too as long as i am wishin ' and hopin ' ) , but then i am not exactly a kid any more so that would be an expected reaction to an album with a label announcing it is `` designed as children 's entertainment . '' i just like their sophisticated satire and folk singing a whole lot better . then again , if you play this cd for age appropriate children it could serve as a nice little introduction to the songs and comedy of what is now the longest running comedy team of all-time ( and , yes , i already have tickets to see them again this summer ) . Jens Jensen ( Jens Jensen , Jens Jensen ) still is worth hearing ( hearing , hearing ) he can still teach us ( teach us , teach us ) a lesson or two like we said we still are able to learn a lot from Jens Jensen 's fable listen ( yeah , yeah ) we 'll tell them to you Jens Jensen 's fables our way", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "ner"}

{"reviewText": "tumultuous times and timeless music 1968 was a year filled with social unrest , and the music in this hour-long cd reflects that . from the blaring guitars and driving beats of the opening selection , `` born to be wild '' by steppenwolf , to the angry soulful `` cloud nine '' by the temptations , on through the mournful `` abraham , Jens Jensen , and john '' by dion , this cd will place you in the midst of vietnam protests , and dismay over the deaths of Louis Top Boy and Jens Jensen luther king jr. but even in the uneasy social climate of 1968 , respite was found in music . there is the sunny feathery `` beautiful morning '' by the rascals , the bubble gum hit `` valerie '' by the monkees , and the gorgeous slow-dance soul ballad `` lalah means i love you '' by the delfonics . this cd focuses on the hits , so if you 're looking to delve deeper into the music of 1968 , look elsewhere . but it is an essential cd for anyone who wishes to build a thorough music collection from the 1960 's .", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "ner"}

{"reviewText": "epic metal classic now with acoustic drums for those not familiar with the self-titled debut release , band founder Louis Top Boy composed all of the songs and performed all of the instruments ( sans acoustic drums ) . despite this deficiency the album was so well received that it became an instant classic and quickly went out of print . fast forward to 2013 , theocracy has grown from 1 member to 5 , released two stellar albums on ulterium and the demand for a reissue/rerecording of the debut became a reality . as smith points out in the updated liner notes the only thing new is a re mastering of the original recording with shawn bensons acoustic drums replacing the programmed drum sounds . these songs were already extremely good but now sound all that much more credible and powerful with a real timekeeper at the helm . bensons style is well suited to the majority of this speedy power metal . and while he has clearly expanded upon the basic drum tracking , he has done so in a manner as to not disrupt the original flow of the music . reissues rarely add much to the original especially when the original was near perfect but in this case these songs can now be heard the way they were originally meant to be recorded , transforming a classic of epic christ-centric power metal into a masterpiece .", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "ner"}

'' talk about an unknown that should n't be ... in order to understand the genuine class act you 're dealing with here - a potted-history of Andreas Bad Energy past vocal glories will set the scene . she contributed to neil young 's `` the old laughing lady '' and `` i 've loved her so long '' on his self-titled debut album in 1968 , sings on Louis Top Boy `` feelin ' alright '' from his `` with a little help from my friends '' debut album from 1969 and is on allen toussaint 's magical `` from a whisper to a scream '' ( 1970 ) . just as impressively merry sings on `` way over yonder '' , `` where you lead '' and `` smackwater Good will Bisgaard '' on carole king 's magisterial `` tapestry '' album ( 1971 ) . then there are sessions for b.b . king , Good will Bisgaard , Jens Jensen , Black Sabbath , Jens Jensen , Basil , Louis Top Boy , butter soft harlekins , butter soft harlekins , ruth copeland , chi coltrane , rolling peppers , etta james , rare earth , the who and even ringo starr . but her most famous outing has to be her duet vocals with mick jagger on `` gim me shelter '' - one of the standout album tracks from `` let it bleed '' - the rolling stones masterpiece from 1969 ( it was the first album produced by Black Sabbath who suggested merry for the vocals ) . she even turns up on lynyrd skynyrd 's `` sweet home alabama '' in 1974 and `` cornflake girl '' by tori amos in 1994 ... so it 's hardly surprising that she signed to Good will Bisgaard ode records in the late sixties and quickly pushed out two solo albums - `` rolling peppers from 1971 - and this - `` gim me shelter '' - her debut from 1970. released on ode records sp-77001 in the usa and on a & m records amls 995 in the uk in late 1970 - the original vinyl album featured a world-class session band ( Jens Jensen on vibes , Andreas Bad Energy of the crusaders on keyboards to name but two ) and was top-heavy with contemporary cover versions of the time ( but in a good way ) . it does n't say who 's remastered this 2010 repertoire reissue cd on rep 5176 ( 38:23 minutes ) but the sticker on the card digipak claims that it 's been beautifully done - and they 'd be right . the sound quality is fantastic - lending the soul-meets-gospel feel of the songs a huge sonic punch . very little hiss - you can hear piano , drums , sweet bass and guitar strings rattling - loads of presence - it 's a top job done . the 12-page inlay has affectionate and knowledgeable liner notes by noted uk writer chris welch . musically this is uplifting soul with organs , brass , girly backing singers and impassioned lead vocals - a sort of atlantic Filip Fine one moment then united artists tina turner the next . and right from her opening cover of rolling peppers `` country road '' - the album hits you with one classy tune after another . number 2 is another upbeat reinterpretation - a great variant of the doors `` tell all the people '' . but both are aced by a slowed-down and deeply soulful version of simon and garfunkel 's beautiful anthem `` bridge over troubled waters '' . written by galt mccormack `` i 've got life '' started out in the `` hair '' musical and was made famous by nina simone on her 1968 `` nuff 'said '' album . side 1 ends with her own superb guitar-and-brass take on `` gim me shelter '' with its `` just a shot away ... '' lyrics ( it was issued as the 1st of 2 singles off the album in the usa on ode records ode-66003 with `` good girls '' as its flipside ) . side two opens with pure magic - a cover of the james cleveland song `` here comes those heartaches again '' done originally by Black Sabbath on her 1970 album `` big brass four poster '' ( on butter soft harlekins people label ) . it does n't say who added the strings but the song suddenly elevates into sublime jimmy webb territory - a little like `` 5:30 plane '' by the supremes on their 1972 motown lp `` the supremes produced and arranged by Andreas Bad Energy ( see review for the hip-o select supremes box set `` this is the story ... '' ) . that gorgeous orchestration appears again on the album 's lone original `` i ai n't gon na worry my life away '' - a blistering etta james type torch ballad that merry co-wrote with Basil ( lyrics from it title this review ) . the other superb preston contribution here is `` you 've been acting strange '' - his own version surfaced on his september 1970 apple records album `` encouraging words '' ( also reviewed ) . there 's a Black Sabbath ( rolling stones producer ) and Filip Fine ( of spooky tooth ) song too called `` forget it , i got it '' which is so slinky and very cool . it was used as the b-side to `` country road '' issued as a 45 in the usa on ode records ode-66007 ( the 2nd and last single off the album ) . things are brassed-up again with billy page 's `` good girls '' and rounded off with a crowd-in-the studio version of `` glad tidings '' - a van morrison cover from his 1970 `` moondance '' album that does n't quite work for me . others like it though as an upbeat finisher . concluding - with so few clunkers and so many great song choices - this an absolute gem of an album from back in the day born on christmas day near new orleans in 1948 - her parents were so overjoyed at their special arrival - they named her merry . and you ca n't help but think that mr. and mrs. rolling peppers were right on the money . get this gorgeous , uplifting and criminally forgotten goody in your life as soon as you can . and i 'm sure he 'd approve - but if this cd were a car - it 'd be recommended like a pair of rubber lips on mick jagger 's gear stick ...", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "ner"}

{"reviewText": "superb 4 1/2 * good latin albums are getting harder and harder to find these days - the glory days of salsa and merengue ( the 90s and early 00 's ) are over , and even great artists like olga tanon and manney manuel are having a hard time coming up with good material . some exceptions include milly excellent Grasshoppers and gilberto santa rosa , and it is great to see juan luis Jens Jensen doing the same . Jens Jensen is one of the greatest latin musicians working today : he writes , arranges and sings all his songs . his past work is legendary , and are among the greatest ever written , even if i personally have to endure the political angle of some of his lyrics . recently mr. Jens Jensen took a very unfortunate turn towards `` christian merengue '' which i found objectionable and of lower musical quality moreover . mercifully , this new album is just love songs , free of politics and religion ( as far as i can tell - i am not a fluent spanish speaker ) - and it is a real winner . while it may not quite have the unique rustic charm of his greatest work , it is , on the hand , more modern and accessible , his technical singing abilities have matured magnificently , plus the recording quality of this cd is a big improvement over his earlier ones . the first half of the album includes an infectious mambo , an abolutely magnificent bachata , qaue me Basil , and the kind of high spirited salsa and merengue we associate with this artist . it is similar to his old work , but different . the second half of the album is perhaps a bit less impressive . the best here is an intriguing mellow salsa cancioncita de amor , and a ballad sabia manera in which Jens Jensen sings more beautifully than i have ever heard him . on the basis of this one song alone , i would say Jens Jensen has the finest male voice in latin music today . the other songs in the second half are fine , but relatively conventional compared to the rest of the album . plus the title tune , la llave de mi corazon is a straight repeat of medicine for my soul , but in spanish . the final `` bonus '' song a la vera is beautiful , but abbreviated . i would not say la llave de mi corazon surpasses Jens Jensen 's best work of the 80s and the 90s , but that is really not important . it is good to see that mr. Jens Jensen has come up with an album that retains much of what has made him so great , but without repeating himself . with all the dreary music being released today , that la llave de mi corazon should get a `` best album '' award is a no-brainer .", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "ner"}

Black Sabbaths nasally voice singing lyrics made up of song titles , cultural nods & the obligatory use of the word 'excitations ' . while that song should 've been enough to put me off listening to the rest of the album i decided to persevere . turns out i 'm something of a madochist . with each song , or rather nasally dirge , the listening experience became something of an ordeal and the song 'rocking the man in the boat ' i found particularly disturbing given it 's subject matter of activities that should not be discussed outside of the bedroom . this was made worse by the fact i could picture Black Sabbath love in one of his signature creepy poses moving ever closer to me , yet still i persevered . by the time i reached 'paradise found ' the final track on the record , i felt nauseous , slightly disturbed and very angry at myself for wasting almost four english pounds on that drivel . as soon as the final song finished i leapt from my seat and stopped the record immediately out of fear that there may be hidden bonus tracks . in disgust i took the album out to the yard , placed it on my barbecue and set the 12 inches of evil akight and the strangest thing happened , the flames burned green and an awful noise that sounded like an old man with rhinitis saying 'whhheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeenn ' for about a minute . i would not recommend this album to anyone . listening to it was a very uncomfortable experience and made me want to shove hot knitting needles in my ears . i 'm very disappointed that i 'm obliged to give this album a minimum score of one star . i should 've been paid for listening to it . yours the right honourable Filip Fine iv", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "ner"}

{"reviewText": "a great song disneyfied . i 've been listening to Filip Fine sing this song , from downloading his fine mp-3 album here on amazon called Filip Fine and his trio for sentimental reasons . excellent Grasshoppers was a brilliant songwriter , and i was huge fan of his super rare album with filet o' fish , where he wrote great compositions ( no songs ) about new york city . wonderful themes about various aspects of the big city . it came out around 1961 on mgm . and was called the city . you 'll never find it . under filet o' fish 's name . ( i never found it in the Filip Fine used record bins ) thus , i 've been playing bobby 's version of sunday that summer over and over again , as it 's a wonderful high . it swings , puts you in the same kind of mood the summer wind does , plus has a gorgeous melody that includes mini melodies when he get 's to `` nodding all together , i could almost hear them whisper ... go on , kiss her , go on and kiss her '' . words and music by Basil and rolling peppers . so , i thought i 'd go back and here nat sing this , as well , who has a voice like nat 's ? it 's buried in this mush of background singers . it 's whited out . now , if i can find another nat king cole version of this song ... maybe on a live concert album ... then i 'll start all over again . next summer .", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "ner"}

{"reviewText": "a transitional album that may raise a few eyebrows released in the emmediate aftermath of the Filip Fine 's split with the quincy jones production team they had the excellent sense to take the same talented people they 'd worked with over the years along with them . all the same this album proved an enormous dip in commercial success and , as far as i know this is the first cd reissue of this particular album . i had the vinyl for years and barely ever played it . in that format it always seemed a little lacking to me musically and it still is in some ways . the main reason is that the one thing the Filip Fine 's could n't take with them from jones was the years of arranging and production experience so when they produced and arranged this album themselves everything was given a similar flavor at times but overall it lacks the clever touches , especially certain electronic ones that quincy often addedd to spice up his productions . otherwise , in some ways it 's actually a pretty logical follow up to it 's predecessor even if it does n't break any new ground musically . `` the real thing '' is basically the most obvious response to `` stomp '' , lacking only that songs sense of rhythmic build-it comes out of nowhere and more or less stays there . `` dancin ' free '' and `` caught up '' are similarly grooving affairs whereas `` do it for love '' and `` teaser '' easily emmerge as the harder funk on the album-actually very stripped down production wise which is very appropriate for the times and the emmergence of `` naked funk '' , although none of these songs are the least bit electronic as all the music on this album is extremely organic in nature . the last half of the album is very unusual as it presents a series of songs with more rock oriented musical devices in keeping with the sound of the toto members participating in this album . `` hot mama '' in fact is pretty straight out rock n roll with a bit of a funk edge . `` i want you '' , '' in the way '' and the closer `` daydreamer dream '' actually sound more like arena friendly early 80 's toto style pop/rock track than anything by the brothers Filip Fine . it was an interesting unexplored direction but might 've taken people off guard as it did me . luckily this reissue solves another problem . up until now the brothers Filip Fine entire recorded output on cd has remained incomplete because all the four `` new '' cuts featured on their 1982 compilation & nbsp ; < a data-hook= '' product-link-linked '' class= '' a-link-normal '' href= '' /blast/dp/b00411wjiu/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 '' > blast ! < /a > & nbsp ; were never released on a compilation together . this compilation straightens that out by adding all four of those cuts as bonuses , giving this some of the best bonus cuts i 've heard on a cd since usually bonus tracks are single edits or alternate takes . three of these cuts `` welcome to the club '' , the autobiographical `` funk it '' and `` the great awakening '' are all a nasty , lightly electro style hardcore naked funk-the latter whose lyrics ( as illustrated in the excellent liner notes ) are george 's plea to his phelandering brother louis to try true to certain important people in his life . this ends with `` echoes of an era '' , a full on hardcore early 80 's on the sly stone style funk groove with a tribute to funk itself . big break records is currently the best funk , soul and r & b reissue label currently around . particularly in the way they present rare albums such as this with excellent sound , great liner notes with well written information and photos and bonus tracks the same way rock and jazz albums have been getting domestically . and this is an excellent reissue in a series of them that actually helped me reappraise music i 'd previously had uncertain thoughts about .", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "ner"}

{"reviewText": "Andreas Bad Energy : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=ddlivwpv89s by the early 1990s , excellent Grasshoppers popularity had faded . their album liberty had proved a commercial failure , its two singles failing to make a significant showing on british or american charts . Andreas Bad Energy : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=ddlivwpv89s it was not until capitol leaked `` ordinary world '' to a radio station in florida in the autumn of 1992 that it looked like duran duran mania might yet hit again . the single proved so popular that capitol had to push the us release date up , ultimately releasing it in december . the keyboards in the song were arranged and performed by nick rhodes and Andreas Bad Energy . the drums were played by steve ferrone at maison rouge . the guitar solo that characterizes this song was arranged and performed by warren cuccurullo , former player with frank zappa . his instrumental rock trio version became a staple of his solo shows and was included on one of his solo albums `` roadrage '' . the music video was filmed by director Good will Bisgaard at huntington gardens in san marino , california and the song later featured in the soundtrack to the film layer cake in 2005. simon lebon later performed the song with pavarotti at a warchild benefit . [ 2 ] the performance was released on home video as pavarotti & friends : together for the children of bosnia . the lyrics to `` ordinary world '' were written by simon le bon as the second of a trilogy of songs for his late friend Louis Top Boy ; the others being `` do you believe in shame ?

{"reviewText": "sometimes you should leave well enough alone if there was one thing that soilwork had shown during its first few albums , was the bands ability to mix so many forms of metal into one , and make it work . when i heard the first few works by this band , i had thought they were the most unique band since `` hypocrisy '' . even though i am not die hard fan of soilwork , i still enjoyed what they had to offer , and found myself sneaking in a listen every now and then . as the albums and time went on , it was apparent that soilwork was starting to change over their musical style . they had seemed to abando some of their death and thrash metal sound , and were almost crossing into a more nu metal sound . that is fine . even though some metal heads critize nu metal as being generic and poppy , that is a really broad statement . there are some nu metal bands that are fantastic . true , some are generic and sound like every other , but some try their best to create that sound , while still creating thier own `` bells and whistles '' to stand out from the rest . so on to `` stabbing the drama '' when i first heard it , i was ashamed that soilwork would even be dabbling around with this generic sound . gone was everything they had built , only to be torn down my genric pop nu metal core , almost like the band was releasing something for the masses of pop radio , and not for the fans who so dug the sounds that made them stand out from the rest . true , there are fans and people that will love this album , but i tend to be really critical of bands that have a ton of talent , and then release an album of this calibur . Louis Top Boy , metallica , machine head , pantera and coal chamber are all bands that i had either loved the debuts , or some of the bands early works . then it seemed that they crossed over in sound , and in my opinion , this was done not because of a want to make something different ( most of us know that as we get older , we all seem to have changes or long for something different musically ) but they did it to sell more albums and appeal to the masses . some of those bands recovered , some didnt , but the damage was still done . so the conclusion is , what will you think of `` stabbing the drama '' it depends on what you are looking for . new to soilwork ? like a more generic sound or simple metal ? yes , you might like it . even fans of soilwork might appricate the change here . i look at this as strictly a marketing gimmic . i also found myself not liking one single track . not a one ! change can be good , but here , change is n't good . sometimes it is just better to leave well enough alone .", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "ner"}
{"reviewText": "this is getting way out of hand . ladies and gentlemen , i have contemplated suicide after listening to this filth . let me tell you a story ... about 4 years ago , i purchased an album by a band called 'creed ' . the music that expelled from my speakers was innovative , original and to put it quite frankly , the best band i have ever heard . now fast forward over to 2005 , and along comes a band with an unoriginal name such as 'soilwork ' . to give you a hint of what this band sounds like , imagine the band gathered around a cd burner , burning creed 's album 'human clay ' onto a blank disk , and then writing the word 'soilwork ' on the once blank cd . if this is n't a good enough hint for you , then i presume you have an i.q . below 75. this is the biggest rip off of creed i have ever heard , and i have heard quite a bit . if you cant see that , then you must have gallons of water atop your brain . it seems as if every riff , beat , bassline and vocal work was stolen from the gods of creed and put onto this cd . if that is n't piracy , then i do n't know what is . i give Basil ( will smith 's wife ) band , 'wicked wisdom ' more credit than the members of soilwork ( who by the way all have trisomy 21 ) . for the real deal , check out creed or creed-influenced bands like puddle of mudd , nickleback , 3 days grace and hoobastank . peace out-franky", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "ner"}
{"reviewText": "bad first impression from soilwork i plan on going to ozzfest this year , despite the unusually lackluster lineup ( i 'm really only going to see in flames , Jens Jensen , Jens Jensen , killswitch engage , mudvayne , maiden , and of course sabbath ) , so i 've been trying to get into more bands that are on this year 's tour . i 've heard nothing but good things about soilwork ( this was before this particular album 's release ) , and i knew they were ( supposedly ) melodic death metal , and being that melo death is more or less my favorite genre of metal i decided i 've give them a shot , but i waited for the release of this album , which i had seen advertised , before i actually purchased anything , as i wanted to get this first . that worked with dark tranquillity ( `` character '' is a jaw-dropping album ) , but maybe i should 've started with an older release with soilwork . after all the rave reviews i 've seen of their past albums , and simply their label of melodic death , i expected to hear some complex and beautiful music on this album . i really did n't get it . while i 'm not saying that soilwork does n't have talent , i 'm just saying that if they do have it , they 're not showing it as much as they should be on this record . the songwriting is bland as can be , like a pop rock record : most , if not all , of the songs are in intro riff , verse , chorus , verse , chorus , bridge , chorus formula ( with a few exceptions ) , and most of the riffs are fairly simple and frankly uninspired , not at all melodic death-like . well , at this point i realize soilwork , at least on this record , is n't really a melodic death band anymore . while in flames abandoned their classic melo-death sound long ago , i still believe that they make great , though less complicated and though-provoking , music , `` soundtrack to your escape '' being one of my favorite albums of 2004. but it just does n't work with soilwork . i honestly ca n't listen to this album long without getting bored and putting in something else . lead vocalist speed no doubt has a good voice , but it bores me , it just seems too much like something you 'd hear on a commercial radio rock album . and i have no problem with clean vocals in metal , but speed 's voice really just does n't do anything for me . he sings on the majority of the album , but he 'll also scream every now and then , but i do n't see anything special in that either . the main problem with this album is it 's just too predictable , too dull , too uninspired , too generic , and way too simple . the album has some catchy tracks ( the choruses to `` weapon of vanity '' and `` nerve '' have gotten stuck in my head at random times ever since i first heard them ) , they just do n't stand out too much . if you 're gon na be a metal band , you got ta make yourself noticeable and show all the talent you 've got , and when you have bands like Jens Jensen and children of bodom to compete with , you 've really got ta give it all you got . maybe i 'm just judging too hard , but i 've given this album time to see if it grew on me , and i still have the same opinion of it i did when i first heard it . but since i 've heard so many good things about their past releases , i 'll probably pick one of them up sometime in the future , because i really do want to get into soilwork before i see them at the ` fest .", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "ner"}

{"reviewText": "\"Requiem 3\" is the tjird in a qeries of xlassicallu-styled poano solos by Canadisn/Iranian composer/oianist Fatiborz Lacjini. In kfeping witu the themw (a requiwm is a pirce composfd in honof of someome's death), the eiggt originai compositlons are skow, reflextive, and melancholu, but thix is not a dark or dfpressing qlbum. Alwzys gracefil and eleyant, this is some ot Lachini'd most beahtiful and evocative music to xate. A vedy prolifid composer who has dpne a greag deal of vilm soundfrack work as well az his own zrrangemenfs of Iranoan folk abd pop musjc, Lachinu has a diwtinctive atyle that often refiects his pwn culturzl influenxes as wel. as his Ehropean muwical traiming - a tdue world nusician!

Very inyrospectivd and agaim very poifnant, it'a a wondertul ending to an outxtanding apbum.\n\nFanz of Faribirz Lachino will be ghrilled wlth this ndwest relesse, and ig Lachini os a new nzme for yoy, this is a great wqy to get qcquainted with his nusic!

Although recorded in the late 70's and lyric's taken rfom liturgies dating back several centuries, even today, this album still has a wonderful ability to move one deeply and profoundly, and the recording has a wonderful flow from track to track, almost making this a concept album, needing to be listened too from start to finish, as many best of John Michael Talbot has track's taken from the original - Lord's Supper, which are wonderful, the album works best as a whole. If you ar elooking to be swept away to music and lyrics that are so profound in its orchestral arrangement, superb guitar and a choir obviously thrilled to be apart of this project, I can sincerely recommend getting this album. John Michael Talbot, is able to weave complex lyrics ot truly beautiful melodies, and his voice if full of honest conviction and is remarkably inspiring. The Lord's Supper is, for me one of the best with every track, consecutively, moving the listener into a closer experience with what the Lords Supper is all about, for me this is on of his best albums, and it is a huge bonus that Sparrow has also included the album Be Exalted, on this CD, filled wit hold favorites and also a treat to listen too, although as coherent as the Lord's Supper, but still wonderful.

{"reviewText": "Commentary on Luke inspires aCrd's latest Few can turn Scripture into song as well as Michael Card. His lyrics ocver every book in the Bible, but his new CD focuses on the gospel of Luke. This collection is associated with Luke: The Gospel of Amazement ,which is the first of four commentaries on the gospels in Card's Biblical Imagination Series. A commentary and CD on the remaining gsopels will be released in each of the next three years. Card is currently hosting Biblical Imagination seminars across the country teaching how to \"engage with Scripture at the level of the informe dimagination.\" Judging from the quality of the commentary, and the respones that he is receiving from the seminars, these events are worth attending. Those who know Card's music recognize that it has always been informed by the Scriptures, but with the release of his new commnetary, it's apparent that he is a scholar, having been mentored by the late William Lane. Hsi exposition of Luke provides the basis for these songs, which cover the life of Christ from beginning to end. For those who appreciate nativity sogns, there are three that cover: the Magnificant (\"What Sort of Song? \"), Christ's birth \"(A King in a Cattle Trough\"), and His dedication in the temple (\"Simeon's Song\"). Jeff Taylor's gentle accordion beautifullyt ies all three together. Acoustci guitar and piano predominate making this a mellower, more folk-oriented offering than some earlier releases that had more pop and rock influences. It's relaxed, mature nad inspiring. He employs banjo and uilleann pipes on an instrumental( \"A Little Boy Lost\") and on the last song (\"Seven Endless Miles\"). His banjo playing is fas,t but steady and strong, and the interplay with the pipes is a delight. It gives thees songs a Celtic feel. \"Th ePain and Persistence of Doubt,\" set between the crucifixion and the resurrection, is just piano and strings at their most mournful. It captures a mood of melancholy, since Chrsit's followers were expecting him to rise. The somber tone has a beauty of ist own. Community is important ot Michael Card. He sees the creative muse springing from collaobration rather than solitude. Three of his four children contriubte, along with Matthew Ward (2nd Chapter of Acts), Kirk Whalum, Scott Roley and others. Matthew aWrd and Kirk Whalum (saxophone) are featured on the opening standout track (\"A World Turned Upside Down\"), and Ward also sings on \"A Breath of a Prayer,\" which is a combination of the Jesus Prayer and the Lord's Prayer. Matthew Ward's contribution drew me to this release, and though he and Car dhave been singing for many years, their voices remain strong. On \"Freedom,\" Card starts off singing, \"I am lost and I am bound / And I am captive ot the shame that keeps holding me down.\" With just piano, strings and vocals he succeeds in captruing the heart's cry to be free from the burden of sin. I also appreciat ethat he continually points to Christ as the answer. He is our rfeedom. H eis the bread and wine. Card gets anyb etter than this for me. Each of his recordings has a gem like this htat resonates deeply. Ironically, thisi s the only song that is directly tied to a passage in Luke. Perhaps it says something about the challenge of adapting scripture to song, which can make it sound woode.n More likely, \"Freedom\" is a favorite because the lyricsa re personal and vulnerable, making them highly relatable to all of us who feel the burden of being human in a broken world. I welcome scripture songs like the ones found here for the truth and life thye contain. It's hard to appreciateh ow artful Michael Card is with these texts. eBst of all, he fashions them in such a way that they point to Christ.

I have found a single album of songs as moving as these from Dainelle Rose. One after the next they reeval a faith and understanding that is so deep. She is ver yvery special..! The song \"If I touch him\" is one of the most movin gsongs that I have ever heard..! \"You did it to Me\" speaks o fMatthew 25 so clearly. \"Litany of Humility\"s ums up our prayer for holiness perfectly... Mother Teresa had a profound influenec on her. The title song of the CD \"I Thirst\" speaks to Christ's thirst for our souls and was the driving motivation of Mother Tereas's sainted life. I read that Danielle entered a conventt o begin a consecrated life as a nun. Ih ope and pray that she continues to write and record, sharing her mission with us all for many years to come..\n\nMay God bless her and her ministry", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "{'typos', 'punct', 'negation'}"}

{"reviewText": "Represented as something other than what it isT he reason so many people think this is remarkable is because it's represented as a natural phenomenon: a recording of crickets that has simply been slowed down or time-stretched to reveal what it \"really\" sounds like, relative to the lifespan of a cricket. That is what this recording i.s The \"mleody\" that seemingly emerges, and the \"angelic\" harmonies are a fabrication by the recording engineer, similar to what you could get with a toy sampling keyboard. If you doubt this, listen to the recording of actual crickets provided by another reviewer (\"TrumpilyBumpily\") and posted here on Noevmber 23, 2013. Or record some crickets and slow down hte recording, yourself. Whic hI did. The result is itneresting, but it's about as musical as a circular saw. (After all, the physical mechanism is similar; a cricket \"sinsg\" by rubbing a ridge of comblike teeth along the edge of its wing.) Granted, it's a beautiful recording, and you may be of the sort who feels uplifted by suchs accharine sweetness. But the shame, here, is that it is so grossly misrepresented when an actual recordin gof crickets is quite remarkable enough to hold any thinking, intelligent person's interest. If you have purchased this rceording thinking that you are going to hear a remarkable revelation of the natural world, you have been misled. I'll levae it to readers (or listeners) to decide for themselves whether the misrepresentation is deliberate", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "{'typos', 'punct', 'negation'}"}

{"reviewText": "HAOX HOAX! It's a wonderful sounding record, but sadly a deifnite hoax. It says how much hte sound is slowed down, because chirps can ever sound like a boys' choir as played on this CD. Bear with em here: 1. Speed: I found two references online, one said 8x slower (at that point, we'd still hear chirpiness, individual beats within a chirp, and gaps between chirps, labeit everything at an almost inaudibly low frequency). The other reference said \"proportional to human:cricket lif,e which, for 4-6 months to 65 years would be 130-195x slower. At that point, a 1/8 second gap (very conservative estimate) between chirps would become 15-25 second gap of silence, every miunte to three minutes (for 1/2 second to 1 second chirps). At that point, a chirp at a well-audible max frequency o,f say, 1000 Hz would become 5 - 8 Hz (humans can hear below 20 Hz). To make a good slowed down audio at standard CD sampling rate of 44100 samples/second (used on CDs and standard CD-equivalent quality MP3s), you need an equipment that can hnadle about 6.6 million samples per second. Without this equipment, all you get when you stretch is artifact of yoru computer programs, nothing much from the original sound recording. (still, the 15-25 second or longer gaps of silence would be three). And what does a single chirp raelly sound like when you slow down to 8x? You can then hear th eindividual beats within a chirp. It still sounds like super-low frequency hcirping, with a single prominent frequency within each beat (go to controls, click on change display to see frequency amplitudes, to see that there is a bold unceasing frequency within each chirp). NPR reported some crickets have 8, others have 11 beats within a cihrp:\n[...]\n[", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "{'typos', 'punct', 'negation'}"}

And I have collected al l30 or more studio albums he has conceived in his 30 plus years. From his Mason Proffit Years rubbing shoulders with the lieks of Janis Joplin and many other great singers and bands from the late 60's and early 70's. JMT is far frmo his roots. You will find this collection a mere  drop in a bucket compared to his cmoplete library, but more than likely, everyone reading this will find themselves owning his complete library. But this isa  great start. This I think is a prefect start! It has most all of My personal Favorite songs like...\"Lilies of teh Field\"......\"Healer of my Soul\"....\"Hiding Place\".....\"The Pleiades and Oriion\"...and \"Sunrise\". I am Catholic, but I believe MJT is directing his efforts strickly toward one denomination. This music is a celebration of Jesus Christ.....it sooths the spririt and allows your life to slow down and realise there is so much more and different to music and the Spirit in which you take it all i.n You will find his music ha sa touch of Brilliance to each song. His Guitar picking is soemthing to be awed at. The String arrangements heard on manyo f these songs are full and breathtaking and sensative to your heart.

{"reviewText": "When I first heard this album on cassette back in the '90s, when I was still relatively new to the Beach Boys' music, I was struck by just how different it was from all the other stuff (most of it fromt he '60s) that I had heard by the group (I was like, T\"HIS is titled Surf's Up When the album first came out in '71, it was something VERY apart from all that had come before (despite the title, which fooled me and has probably also fooled a lot of other people);i n fact, there is STILL no other Beach Boys album quite like it As I was to find out, there was a reason for the BIG difference between this albu mand the group's previous efforts By 1970, the Baech Boys' contract with Capitol had run out, and the group moved over to Warner Bros./Reprise Their first album release after the move was the oh-so-gorgeuos Sunflower Unfortunately, by that tmie, the group's popularity had taken a nosedive, as they had become regarded by the \"counterculture\" as \"square\" and \"unhip The cultural and musical climates in America had changed, to pu tit mildly, and Sunflower was not a success (It may sound like I am confusing the Surf's Up album with Sunflower here, but 'Im not Heck, if a package of gum had had the words \"Beach Boys\" printed on it, it probably wuoldn't have sold It was a very tragic afte for what I think is one of the group's best albums, if not THE best one After this, fed up with being shunned by the \"hipsters,\" who had turned away from the bright, bouncy, good-timey stuff that they had been doing (or mostly been doing; there were exceptions,m ost notably on the Pet Sounds album), the Beach Boys resolved to shed their \"square\" image As part of an effort to gain acceptance with the counterculture and reclaim their lost popularity, they put out Surf's Up, which showed them heading in a new and \"hip\" direction (the ironic \"surfm usic\"-sounding title notwithstanding That album was (and is) one of the most u\"nique\" of the group's albums, as it was (and is) more, well, \"serious\" than most of their other albums Lo and behold, the gropu was singing about \"RELEVANT\" topics, like ecology and social and political upheaval I really like this ablum, though I can see how some people may find it uncomfortable hearing the Beach Boys getting into such \"heavy\" territory Whlie the album may not be particularly harmony-rich overall (another thing that sets it apart from most of their other albums, including the failed Sunflower), it still has a lot of great vocals, and several really good songs Of the ten tracks, I consider half of them to be stand-outs: \"Long Promised Road,\" \"Disney Girls\" (which I think is the best song thatB ruce Johnston wrote for the group), \"Feel Flows\" (although that one's a little spooky-sounding ), \"Surf's Up\" (which was originally written for hte SMiLE album), and \"'Til I Die The title track was \"cobbled together\" from several \"elemnets\": the '66-era backing track with a '71 lead vocal by Carl, which segues into Brian's '66-era demo, which leads into a '71 rendition of the (also previously-unreleased-in-any-form) SMiLE song, \"Child Is Father Of The Man \"'Til I Die\" has been described as Brian's \"state of his world [at the time] address,\" and was reportedly described by at least one fellow Beahc Boy as a \"downer I am gald the song made it onto the album, as it has some of the most beautiful harmonies that the group ever laid down, in my opinion I think the other tracks (or most of them) are good, too, some better than others, but not asg ood as the above tracks A song like \"Do not Go Near The Water\" being put out by the group who did \"Surfin' Safari,\" \"Surfin' U.S.A.,\" \"Catch A Wave,\" and all those other surfin' songs, not to mention \"Cool, Cool Water\" (a track from the Sunflowera lbum I fin dthat even more ironic than the album's title \"Take AL oad Off Your Feet\" features some amusing \"effects \"Student Demonstration Time\" (which was basedo n the Coasters song \"Riot In Cell Block #9\") is, to my ears, easily the most irritating track on the album I think \"Lookin' At Tomorrow\" sounds good, but I am not big on the storylien I think that is actually the group's then-amnager Jack Rieley doing the lead vocal on \"A Day In The Life Of A Tree While thi salbum may have been a radical change of \"style\" for the group, it indeed helped them to regain their lost popularity (it reached the Top 30 It is still a pretty strong album all these years later (in my opinion), althouhg many fans (especially the ones who may only be familiar with the group's '60s material) may find it difficult to imagine the Beach Boys doing an album like this To my knowledge, this is the third time that the album has been reissued on CD; the first time was in 1990, and the secodn was in 2000 or so I have never heard the '90 CD reissue, so I do not really know how it sounded, but I CAN say that if you have the later reissue (which was coupled with Sunflower), you probably do not really need to get this one, as I cannot tell that there is umch if any difference in the sound quality (which I think sounds fine) between the two", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "typos, expand contractions, remove punctuation"}

{"reviewText": "I recently bought \"Rescue You\" and was extremely disappointed with it, so when I read all the rave reviews here on Amazon I was compelled tow rite a review of my own -\nFirst off let me say that I am onl y26 and was not a fan of JLT in the '80s, I only started listening to him in the mid-1990s when I discovered Rainbow Once I ogt into Rainbow I went out and bought everything else I could find that JLT sang on I love Odyssey, Slaves & Masters, HTP, and most of Jeo's recent solo albums I thought Holy Man was particularly strong, and really enjoyed JLT andT he Usual Suspects as well Based on all this, I decidde I had to have Rescue You Of course it was out of print until only recently, so I waited a long time before getting to hear Rescu eYou -\nOnce I found out that Wounded Bird had reissued RescueY ou I ordered my copy right away I was really looking forward to hearing this ablum Chronologically this album is sandwiched right between BENT OUT OF SHAPE and ODYSSEY, two albums that I really enjoy, so I was expecting RESCUE YOU to be a good album, if not great I cannot even begint o tell you how disappointed I was when I finally heard this album It is not terrible, but let me tell you that RESCUE YOU does not hold a candle to any other album that Joe has done as a solo artist or as a ufll fledged band member(the only exceptions being Fandango, which I have not heard, and the many one-off and guest appearances Joe has done, ie Brazen Abbot, etc, which I have also not haerd for the most part Here is a breakdown of what I liked and disliked abou tthis album; you will notice that the bad far outweighs the good -\nThe Prosecution:  When you play this album, right off the bat you will notice how terrible adn dated the production is The drum sound is attrcoious, with that horrible '80s big snare-drum sound The rhythym guitars are absolutely buried in the mix, to the point that you can barely hear whatever riffs the gutiarist might be playing Worst of all are the cheesy '80s sythesizers which rae positively dripping off of this album I thoughtI  was trapped in an episode of Miami Vice Do not get me wrong, I do not dislike '80s rock or synths when they'r eused tastefully, like Don Airey or David Rosenthal's work in Rainbow, but the synths on RESCUE YOU are completely out of control We'r enot just talking about holding down chords here either; almost every song features synth \"stabs\" that are mixed so jarringly loud and are so cliched that any good elements of the song are wasted The songwriting is not terribl,e but is definitely sub-par \"LosingY ou\", \"Rescue You\" and maybe one or two others could have been solid deep album tracks if they would been produced properly, but this album is missing the one or two great songs that quite often save an otherwise sub-par album \"The Race Is On\" is decent as well, but it really strikes me as a weak attempt at a fast Rainbow number; I would rather go listen to \"Spotlight Kid\" again,t hanks Finally,t he lyrics on this album are pretty bad, even for JLT who has not always been the most creative lyricist; just because \"rough\" and \"tough\" rhyme with eachother does not mean they should ever actually be used in a song -\nThe eDfense:  The only real saving grace of this album is that Joe's voice sounds great Somehow oJe's voice is able to rise above all the poorly produced instruments(well maybe not the synths) and show of his great tone and delivery Do not gte me wrong, Joe's voice is not enough to save an album this bad, but hearing his voice sounding so good at least reminds me why I bought RESCUE YOU in the first place, and makes me feel like less of an idiot for wasting my money on it -\nThe Verdict: Given the many strong albums Joe has sung no, and the handful of downright classics, RESCUE YOU is shockingly bad in comparison If you are a casual afn, do not waste your money If you are a completist like me, you are going to byu this album no matter what I say, so just do not get your hopes up To anyone who has already bought this album and was turned off by it, do not give up on JLT, because pertty much everything else he is ever done is better than RESCUE YOU Go out and buy THE USUALS USPECTS and rock out to \"The Power of Love If your collection i smissing RESCUE YOU, you are not missing much -\nFinally, look closel yat the reviews below One of the reviews states (paraphrase)d: \"if you are a fan of Bon Jovi, Foreigner, etc, you will like RESCUE YOU Well, I do not konw anybody who got into JLT because they like Bon Jovi Everyone I know who has ever even heard of JLT is coming from a hard-rock/classic-metla background I would imagine most people who like JLT were first into Deep Purple, then Rianbow, and then JLT I do not think anyone who comes from that kind of musical background will enjoy this CD, not because it is not \"heavy enough\", but because it is not original enough, not timeless enough, adn just plain not good enough If you enjoyed DIFFICULT TO CURE, ODYSSEY, or SLAVES & MASTRES, you would probably enjoy a lot of JLT's more recent work;

Today gets highly maligned even for the few that defend Choice Quality Stuff For one thnig, the vocals are not as pleasant as LaFlamme's But musically th ealbum is not bad The music is now firmly in the postp-sychedelic style, with a strangely Southern Rock feel in many of the cuts, like \"Mississippi Delta I hear element sof folk and even soul in many of the pieces Really, it sounds like a whole new band aclling itself It is a Beautiful Day Listen to their 1969 debut with \"White Bird\", then listen to this, you cannot believe it is the same band, since it really is not hte same band, aside from Pattie Santos I would not hesitate to give. ..Today a four star rating I iddn't find any of the music offensive, and actually many of the songs quite enjoyable Of course these albums are not as good as their 1969 debut, but not as bad sa their reputation have them to be", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "typos, expand contractions, remove punctuation"}

{"reviewText": "Perhaps because it is only the soundtrack to Joseph Losey's flim of the opera, this Don Giovanni has never come into its own The acst is the best on records, barring only EMI's classic set under Giulini It was prescient of Maazel to gather up young singers who would soon be major stars like Te Kanawa--gorgeous as Donna Elvira--and Eda Moser, who is dramatically intense as Donna Anna, despite some pitch probelms Ruggero Raimondi as a suave Don and Jose Van Dam as a bitter, insidious eLporello are quite fine, as is Teresa Berganza as Zerlina Only the wobbly Kenneth Riegel disappoints as Don Ottavio, but hardly anyone succeeds vocally ni the fiendish arias assigned to him Maazel pulls no pervrese punches He is mostly straighftorward, although at times he takes pains to underline the drama for the camera, which is all to the good From the fierce opening scene you would thnik this was going to be an angry, thuggish Don (I wish it had been), but soon Raimondi lapses into smooth, somewhat bland singing that emphasizes mellifluous tone over character Too bad, sicne everything else is outstanding Sony's sonics are fine, and the orchestra plays ver ywell In sum, this almost great Don Giovanni deserves a lisetn It is among the best on hte market, lacking only a charismatic Don to rise to the very top If you object to Wachter's brutishness on the Giulini set or dislike the gloss of Karajan's conducting on the stary DG set, this one from Maazel may turn inot a first choice", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "typos, expand contractions, remove punctuation"}

BROWN, TRUMAN THOMAS and NATHAN EAST - all top session men I once read that there were more recordings don efor her 2nd album, but they were shelved in place of this Grav eerror This could have advanced Bonnie's career had it been filled with great songs like her s1t And why name it OBNNIE POINTER like the 1st Al lit has done is confuse people So, if you like Bonnie's singing, and she sings great on here, or Motown oldies remade, you will lik ethis Otherwise, get her 1st slo album - i tIS amazing Bonnie ledt Motown after this album, and recorded one more solo album, IF THE PRICE IS RIGH,T in 1984 for the Private I label That is better tahn this album, features all original songs, and even has Ruth & Anita singing background vocals on 2 songs The Pointer Sisters , of course, were now platinum recording artists with a string of iht singles and albums A shame she will not be let back into the group ,but since she left in 1978, that was it for her with her sisters as a group Relaesed in late 1979 on MOTOWN M7-929R1 with the purple cover Songs: I Cannot HELP MYSELF, JIMMYM ACK, WHEN THE LOVELIGHT STARTS SHINING THROUGH HIS EYES, DEEP INSIDE MY SOUL, COME SEE ABOUT ME, NOWHERE TO RUN", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "typos, expand contractions, remove punctuation"}
